<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In 1919 the writer was appointed by the Master and
Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, Lees Knowles
Lecturer in Military and Naval History for the academical
year 1919-20, and the lectures are now printed almost exactly
in the form in which they were delivered in November,
1919.</p>

<p>The object of the Lecturer was to present in a convenient
form the general conclusions about the administration of the
Royal Navy from the Restoration to the Revolution arrived
at in the introductory volume of his <cite>Catalogue of Pepysian
Manuscripts</cite>, published by the Navy Records Society in 1903
with a dedication, in the two hundredth year after his death,
'to the memory of Samuel Pepys, a great public servant.'
The evidence there collected shews that Pepys, familiar
to the last generation in the sphere of literature, was also a
leading figure in an entirely different world, who rendered
inestimable services to naval administration in spite of the
peculiar difficulties under which he worked. These conclusions,
with a part of the evidence on which they depend, are
summarised in the present volume.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to the Master and Fellows of Trinity
College for encouraging the enterprise; to the Council of the
Navy Records Society for permission to use the material
already published in the Society's series; to the Delegates
of the Oxford Clarendon Press for allowing the author to
use and quote from his Introduction to the reprint of Pepys's
<cite>Memoires of the Royal Navy, 1679-88</cite>, issued in the Tudor
and Stuart Library in 1906; and to Messrs Sidgwick and
Jackson for a similar permission to use the Introduction to
the section on 'Sea Manuscripts' in <cite>Bibliotheca Pepysiana</cite>.</p>

<h2>LECTURE <abbr title="1">I</abbr><br />

<small>INTRODUCTORY</small></h2>


<p>The materials for the administrative history of the Royal
Navy from the Restoration to the Revolution are largely
contributed by Cambridge.</p>

<p>The section of the Pepysian Library at Magdalene which
Samuel Pepys classified as 'Sea Manuscripts' contains 114
volumes, the contents of which cover a wide field of naval
history. Pepys's leading motive in collecting these is probably
to be found in his projected 'History of the Navy.'
Early in his career he thought of writing a 'History of the
Dutch War,' 'it being a thing I much desire, and sorts
mightily with my genius.'<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> Later on the design expanded
into a complete naval history, upon which, at the time of his
death, he was supposed to have been engaged for many
years. Evelyn writes in his <cite>Diary</cite> on 26 May, 1703: 'This
day died Mr Samuel Pepys, a very worthy, industrious, and
curious person, none in England exceeding him in knowledge
of the navy.... He had for divers years under his hand
the History of the Navy, or <cite>Navalia</cite> as he called it; but how
far advanced, and what will follow of his, is left, I suppose,
to his sister's son.' Pepys's correspondence with Evelyn and
Sir William Dugdale suggests that it would have included
in its scope the antiquities of the Navy and possibly the
history of navigation, as well as administrative history; and
this view is supported by his selection of 'sea' manuscripts
for his Library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>These manuscripts may be roughly classified in three
groups:</p>

<p>(i) Official documents of Pepys's own time, the presence
of which in the Library may be explained by the predatory
habits of retiring officials in his day. Among these are to
be found collections of real importance for the administrative
history of the navy during his time, such as (1) <cite>Naval and
Admiralty Precedents</cite> from 1660 to 1688—described as 'a
collection of naval forms and other papers, serving for information
and precedents in most of the principal occasions of
the Admiralty and Navy calling for the same'; (2) <cite>Admiralty
Letters</cite>, 14 volumes containing the whole of the ordinary
correspondence which passed out of Pepys's office during his
two Secretaryships, 1673-1679 and 1684-1688<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a>—the equivalent
of the modern letter-copying books, but in those days
transcribed afresh with laborious care by a staff of clerks;
(3) the <cite>Admiralty Journal</cite>, the minute-book of the Commission
of the Admiralty from 1674 to 1679; (4) <cite>Naval Minutes</cite>,
a volume in which Pepys made miscellaneous memoranda,
many of them notes for his projected History; and (5) the
<cite>Navy White Book</cite>, in which he noted abuses in shorthand,
and wrote down what he called 'matters for future reflection'
arising out of the Second Dutch War.</p>

<p>(ii) A second group of papers consists of official and
unofficial documents—many of them acquired or copied at
some expense—brought together deliberately in order to
serve as material for the projected 'History of the Navy.'
These include (1) a copy of Sir William Monson's <cite>Naval
Discourses</cite>; (2) copious extracts from naval authorities and
historians carefully indexed; (3) Penn's <cite>Naval Collections</cite>,
being 'a collection of several manuscripts, taken out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>Sir William Penn's closet, relating to the affairs of the Navy';
(4) various volumes relating to shipbuilding and navigation,
including the curious and valuable work entitled <cite>Fragments
of Ancient Shipwrightry</cite> and Sir Anthony Deane's <cite>Doctrine of
Naval Architecture</cite>. This last contains delicate and elaborate
drawings of a ship of each rate, and Evelyn records in his
<cite>Diary</cite> under date 28 January, 1682, the remarkable impression
which a sight of it made upon him: 'Mr Pepys, late
Secretary to the Admiralty, showed me a large folio containing
the whole mechanic part and art of building royal
ships and men-of-war, made by Sir Anthony Deane, being
so accurate a piece from the very keel to the lead block,
rigging, guns, victualling, manning, and even to every individual
pin and nail, in a method so astonishing and curious,
with a draught, both geometrical and in perspective, and
several sections, that I do not think the world can shew the
like. I esteem this book as an extraordinary jewel.' There
also falls into this group (5) the large and important collection
in eleven volumes entitled by Pepys <cite>A Miscellany of
Matters Historical, Political, and Naval</cite>. This contains
copies of 1438 documents, transcribed from various sources,
and ranging from a complete copy in 114 folio pages of
Sir Philip Meadows's work on the Sovereignty of the Seas
down to 'A true Copy of the Great Turke his Stile which
he most commonly writeth in His great Affaires.' They
include documents relating to naval abuses; papers concerning
salutes and the history of the flag, shipbuilding,
victualling, and finance; a number of patents, commissions,
and lists of ships; transcripts from the Black Book of the
Admiralty; and collections relating to the Shipwrights'
Company and to the Corporation of Trinity House.</p>

<p>(iii) The third group consists of books and papers which
specially appealed to Pepys's characteristic curiosity, and
have no direct bearing upon naval history. The line between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>this and the second group cannot, however, be sharply drawn,
as few of the 'Sea Manuscripts' are merely curious, and
irrelevant to the history of the navy as Pepys himself interpreted
it. The contents of this group are not important for
our present purpose, but one interesting fact may be noted.
The inclusion in the <cite>Miscellanies</cite> of papers relating to
Sir William Petty's calculations and experiments, and of a
copy of 'A Discourse made by Sir Robert Southwell before
the Royal Society, 8 April, 1675, touching Water,' suggests
that Pepys's scientific interests were genuine, and were not
due, as has been suggested, to a desire to commend himself
to Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>.</p>


<p class="mt2">It is fortunate for the student of naval administration
during the Restoration period that the 'Sea Manuscripts'
in the Pepysian Library include two 'Discourses'<a name="Anchor-3" id="Anchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> upon
naval abuses written at the beginning of the period, which
enable us to understand some of the difficulties with which
Pepys and his colleagues had to contend. The <cite>Second
Discourse</cite> by John Hollond, in succession Paymaster, Commissioner,
and Surveyor of the Navy under the Commonwealth
Government, following a <cite>First Discourse</cite> of 1638,
is dated 1659; and the <cite>Discourse</cite> by Sir Robert Slyngesbie,
a royalist naval commander, made Comptroller of the Navy
on the King's return, is dated 1660. These give us the
criticisms of a Parliamentarian of administrative experience
and those of a royalist of experience at sea, made at the
Restoration and supplying an excellent groundwork for the
study of the period which followed it.</p>

<p>There is no time to traverse the whole field of the <cite>Discourses</cite>,
but certain points may be considered by way of
illustration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>1. They bring into relief the remarkable durability of
naval abuses. John Hollond was not the first writer to denounce
abuses in the navy. This had been a fruitful topic
for anonymous writers long before his day, and if the scattered
papers on the subject were collected they would constitute
a complete literature. The charges begin at least as
early as the time of Hawkyns, and one writer<a name="Anchor-4" id="Anchor-4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> accuses him
of what has always been regarded as one of the more modern
refinements of cheating—the manufacture of a complete set
of false books and vouchers for the purpose of baffling enquiry.
The Pepysian Library contains copies of a number of
exposures ranging from 1587 to 1611. The Reports of the
Commissions of 1608 and 1618, and in a lesser degree of
that of 1626, are of special importance in the history of the
evolution of fraud. Sir William Monson, who in 1635
'turned physician' and studied 'how to cure the malignant
diseases of corruption' that had 'crept in and infected his
Majesty's whole navy,'<a name="Anchor-5" id="Anchor-5"></a><a href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> assigns some passages in his <cite>Naval
Tracts</cite> to naval abuses; and in 1636 the Earl of Northumberland,
fresh from the experience of a naval command,
denounces them in a state paper to the King in Council<a name="Anchor-6" id="Anchor-6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a>.
Hollond only develops in detail earlier themes, and Pepys,
who thought very highly of his <cite>Discourses</cite>, 'they hitting the
very diseases of the navy which we are troubled with now-a-days,'<a name="Anchor-7" id="Anchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a>
takes up the same tale. And such is the tenacity
of life exhibited by a well-established naval abuse, that a
Parliamentary enquiry of 1783<a name="Anchor-8" id="Anchor-8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> into the Victualling Department
at Portsmouth revealed malpractices of a kind very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>similar to those described by Hollond. The keys of the
victualling storehouses had been entrusted to improper recipients,
who had access to the stores at all hours; certain
persons kept hogs in the King's storehouses, which were
'fed with the King's serviceable biscuit'; planks, spars,
staves, and barrels were converted to private use; 'mops and
brooms' from the store were appropriated by an official who
'kept a shop and dealt in those articles'; the King's wine
was drawn off in large quantities 'in bottles in a clandestine
manner'; certificates were granted for stores before they
were actually received, and for articles received short, these
being signed in blank by the clerk of the check beforehand;
it was a 'common practice' to send in bags of bread deficient
in weight; the accounts were imperfectly kept, and
showed enormous deficiencies of stores; by collusion with
the contractor stores were accepted that were 'of improper
quality and not according to contract'; and the victualling
board paid excessive prices to a bread contractor with
whom they were in collusion and refused to allow others to
tender.</p>

<p>2. Let me give you next a few illustrations of the kind
of abuse which Hollond and his predecessors had pointed
out, and with which Pepys and his colleagues had to deal.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Hollond, like Pepys, appears to have had a genuine
sympathy for the sorrows of the 'poor seaman,' and he
complains bitterly of the long delays in paying wages; the
'intolerable abuse to poor seamen in their wages' by naval
captains' who are of late turned merchants, and have and
do lay magazines of clothes, ... tobacco, strong waters, and
such like commodities into their ships upon pretence of relieving
poor seamen in their wants, but indeed for no other
reason than their private profit'<a name="Anchor-9" id="Anchor-9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a>; the practice of discharging
sick men without adequate funds to take them home;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>and the payment of wages by tickets instead of cash, thus
creating a depreciated paper currency.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Hollond also speaks strongly against the practice of
using the State's labour in the gardens or grounds of officials,
and the State's materials in repairing private houses or
sumptuously decorating official residences, 'by painting,
paving, and other ornamental tricking.'<a name="Anchor-10" id="Anchor-10"></a><a href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> Here he attacks a
longstanding abuse, for a writer of 1597 had already charged
the Comptroller of the Navy with employing five labourers
from the dockyard 'by the space of half a year' at his house
at Chatham 'about the making of a bowling alley and planting
of trees,'<a name="Anchor-11" id="Anchor-11"></a><a href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a> and in 1603 Phineas Pett was accused of
appropriating the King's timber 'to make a bridge into his
meadow' and to set up 'posts to hang clothes on in his
garden,' and also labour for the same<a name="Anchor-12" id="Anchor-12"></a><a href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a>. It is true that Pett's
accuser is not above suspicion, for he begins his philippic
with an artless exposition of his motives: 'In the last year
of the Queen's reign, I, seeing some abuses by Phineas Pett,
told him he had not done his duty. He strook me with his
cudgel. I told him he had been better he had held his hand,
for he should pay for it.' Pett was in some respects a calumniated
man, but this particular kind of peculation is more
easily justified to the official conscience than any other, and
there is nothing inherently improbable in the accusation.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The combination of captains and pursers to return
false musters, or to present men to receive pay who never
served, was another longstanding abuse. There was in the
navy a recognised system of drawing pay for non-existent
persons to which no discredit attached, for it was the regular
way of giving the officers extra pay. Thus the captains were
allowed a 'dead pay' apiece on the sea-books 'for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>retinues'; and in harbour no less than four varieties of dead
pay were recognised, including wages and victuals paid to
men for keeping ships 'which long since had no being.' We
also hear of an allowance demanded in the Narrow Seas
'for a preacher and his man, though no such devotion be
ever used on board.' The same principle appears in the
18th century in connexion with what were known as 'widows'
men.' The captain was authorised to enter one or two fictitious
persons in every hundred men of his ship's complement,
and the wages drawn in their names and the value
of the victuals to which they would have been entitled were
applied to the relief of the widows of officers and seamen
who had served in the navy<a name="Anchor-13" id="Anchor-13"></a><a href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a>. In the 16th and 17th centuries,
however, the established principle was liable to a variety of
fraudulent applications. A paper of 1603 gives a circumstantial
account of a case in which the companies of a
squadron of four ships were mustered, and it was found that
of 1250 men charged for, only 958 were actually serving,
the King being 'abused in the pay of 292 men, which for
four months, the least time of their employment,' was £800<a name="Anchor-14" id="Anchor-14"></a><a href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a>.
The Report of the Commission of 1608 explains how this
could happen, for 'the captains, being for the most part poor
gentlemen, did mend their fortunes by combining with the
pursers'<a name="Anchor-15" id="Anchor-15"></a><a href="#Footnote-15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a>; and Hollond, in his <cite>First Discourse</cite>, urges as a
remedy 'an increase of means from the King' for 'all
subordinate ministers acting in the navy,' since 'for want
thereof' they are 'necessitated to one of these two particulars,
either to live knaves or die beggars—and sometimes
to both.'<a name="Anchor-16" id="Anchor-16"></a><a href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The danger of collusion among officials was one of
the chief difficulties in the way of would-be reformers, and
just as collusion between the captains and the pursers defrauded
the King in the matter of pay, so collusion between
the victuallers and the pursers defrauded the King over the
provision of victuals. Sir William Monson, in his <cite>Naval
Tracts</cite>, gives instances of such collusion, and shews how
easily it can be managed. Thus the victualler and the purser
would contract between themselves for the purser to be
allowed to victual a certain number of men on board each
ship, paying the victualler for the privilege but making
his own profit on the victuals he supplied. 'Which,' says
Monson, 'besides that it breeds a great inconvenience, for
the purser's unreasonable griping the sailors of their victuals,
and plucking it, as it were, out of their bellies, it makes
them become weak, sick, and feeble, and then follows an
infection and inability to do their labour, or else uproars,
mutinies, and disorders ensue among the company.'<a name="Anchor-17" id="Anchor-17"></a><a href="#Footnote-17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a> Even
if the officers of the ship did their duty, it was sometimes
the case that the higher authorities ashore intervened from
corrupt motives. Monson tells us that when the <i>James</i> was
taking in victuals in Tilbury Hope, 'there appeared a certain
proportion of beef and pork able with its scent to have
poisoned the whole company, but by the carefulness of the
quartermasters it was found unserviceable. Yet after it was
refused by the said officers of the ship, and lay upon the
hatches unstowed, some of the Officers of the Navy repaired
aboard and, by their authority and great anger, forced it to
be taken in for good victuals.... My observation to this point
is that, though the Officers of the Navy have nothing to do
with the victualling part, yet it is likely there is a combination
betwixt the one and the other, like to a mayor of a
corporation, a baker, who for that year will favour the brewer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>that shall the next year do the like to his trade when he
becomes mayor.'<a name="Anchor-18" id="Anchor-18"></a><a href="#Footnote-18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a> Hollond's remedy for these abuses was to
abolish the victualling contractor altogether, and for the
State to take over the victualling by means of a victualling
department<a name="Anchor-19" id="Anchor-19"></a><a href="#Footnote-19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a>. This system of victualling 'upon account,' as
it was called, was actually adopted from 1655 to the Restoration,
and again after 1683; but the difficulties were not
altogether met by the change, for the officials who victualled
'upon account' were liable to collusion with the vendors of
victuals from whom they bought, and in this case the King's
service suffered in a different way.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The administrative defects of the victualling recurred
on almost as serious a scale in the department of stores,
and great complaints are made, both by John Hollond
and the earlier writers, of the bad quality of cordage and
timber and of the frauds connected with their purveyance.
Cordage would be entered by the storekeeper as heavier than
it weighed; old cordage would be sold at absurdly low prices
to the minor officials of the dockyard; and materials still fit
for service would be condemned as unserviceable by an
official who himself acted as a contractor for purchasing unserviceable
stores<a name="Anchor-20" id="Anchor-20"></a><a href="#Footnote-20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a>. The inefficiency of the surveyors of timber
led them to purchase bad materials<a name="Anchor-21" id="Anchor-21"></a><a href="#Footnote-21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a>, and their dishonesty
provoked them to glut the King's stores with defective timber
at exorbitant prices<a name="Anchor-22" id="Anchor-22"></a><a href="#Footnote-22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a> in order to favour the monopolist or
merchant with whom they were in profitable collusion.</p>


<p class="mt2">The worst and most corrupt period of naval administration
was the reign of James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>, and by the Restoration the navy
was on a higher plane of efficiency and honesty; but the
criticisms of such writers as Hollond and Slyngesbie shew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>how much remained for the reformer to do. It is remarkable
that the period of the later Stuarts, so deeply sunk in political
corruption, produced a great naval organizer and reformer in
the person of Samuel Pepys.</p>

<p>There are 17 different ways of spelling the Diarist's name,
but only three of pronouncing it. The descendants of his
sister Paulina, now represented by the family of Pepys
Cockerell, pronounce it <em>Peeps</em>; this is also the established
tradition at Magdalene, and is probably the way in which
Samuel himself pronounced it. The branch of the Pepys
family which is now represented by the Earl of Cottenham,
pronounce their name <em>Peppis</em>. The British public calls it
<em>Peps</em>, and this is the only pronunciation in favour of which
there is no family or other tradition. An epigram contributed
to the <cite>Graphic</cite> in November, 1891, not only comes to a
wrong conclusion about the pronunciation, but is also full
of misleading statements about the man:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">There are people, I'm told—some say there are heaps—</div>
      <div class="verse">Who speak of the talkative Samuel as Peeps;</div>
      <div class="verse">And some, so precise and pedantic their step is,</div>
      <div class="verse">Who call the delightful old Diarist, Pepys;</div>
      <div class="verse">But those I think right, and I follow their steps,</div>
      <div class="verse">Ever mention the garrulous gossip as Peps.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But is he nothing more than 'the talkative Samuel,' 'the
delightful old Diarist,' 'the garrulous gossip'? Even 'old' is
the wrong epithet unless it is restricted to historical antiquity,
for Pepys was not 27 when he began the <cite>Diary</cite><a name="Anchor-23" id="Anchor-23"></a><a href="#Footnote-23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a>, and
only 36 when the partial failure of his eyesight compelled
him, to his great regret, to give it up, 'which is almost as
much as to see myself go into my grave.'<a name="Anchor-24" id="Anchor-24"></a><a href="#Footnote-24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a> Yet he lived to
be 70 years of age, and although for part of his career he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>was out of office, he certainly became, what Monck had
called him earlier with exaggerated compliment, 'the right
hand of the navy.'<a name="Anchor-25" id="Anchor-25"></a><a href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a> The maturity of his powers lies outside
the period of the <cite>Diary</cite>, and it is his later life that makes
good his claim to be regarded as one of the best public
officials who ever served the State. In fact, Pepys's <cite>Diary</cite> is
only a by-product of the life of Samuel Pepys.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the <cite>Diary</cite>, in spite of its infinite accumulations
of unimportant detail, and its conscientious record of
small vices, shews us the great official in the making. Let
me give two illustrations, one on the lower levels of the
<cite>Diary</cite> and the other where it reaches its highest plane.</p>

<p>30 May, 1660: 'All this morning making up my accounts,
in which I counted that I had made myself now worth about
£80, at which my heart was glad and blessed God.' 3 June,
1660: 'At sermon in the morning; after dinner into my
cabin to cast my accounts up, and find myself to be worth
near £100, for which I bless Almighty God, it being more
than I hoped for so soon.' 5 September, 1660: 'In the
evening, my wife being a little impatient, I went along with
her to buy her a necklace of pearl, which will cost £4. 10<i>s.</i>,
which I am willing to comply with her in for her encouragement,
and because I have lately got money, having now
above £200 cash beforehand in the world. Home, and having
in our way bought a rabbit and two little lobsters, my wife
and I did sup late, and so to bed.' This methodical care in
calculating ways and means and recording expenditure,
when applied to the greater affairs of the navy, appears as
a habit of method and order, and a remarkable instinct for
business. Pepys introduced into a slipshod and rather
chaotic organisation a high degree of system and method,
and so vastly increased its efficiency in every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>My other illustration is from the account given in the
<cite>Diary</cite> of the funeral of Sir Christopher Myngs, who had
been mortally wounded in action on the last day of the great
battle with the Dutch off the North Foreland, June 1-4,
1666. Pepys was present at the funeral in a coach with
Sir William Coventry, at which, he tells us<a name="Anchor-26" id="Anchor-26"></a><a href="#Footnote-26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a>, 'there happened
this extraordinary case—one of the most romantique that
ever I heard of in my life, and could not have believed but
that I did see it; which was this:—About a dozen able,
lusty, proper men come to the coach-side with tears in
their eyes, and one of them that spoke for the rest begun
and says to Sir W. Coventry, "We are here a dozen of us
that have long known and loved and served our dead
commander, Sir Christopher Mings, and have now done
the last office of laying him in the ground. We would be
glad we had any other to offer after him, and in revenge
of him. All we have is our lives; if you will please to
get his Royal Highness to give us a fireship among us
all, here is a dozen of us, out of all which choose you one
to be commander, and the rest of us, whoever he is, will
serve him; and, if possible, do that that shall show our
memory of our dead commander, and our revenge." Sir W.
Coventry was herewith much moved (as well as I, who could
hardly abstain from weeping), and took their names, and so
parted; telling me he would move his Royal Highness as
in a thing very extraordinary, which was done.' No more
touching tribute than this has ever been paid to the memory
of a great seaman, nor better evidence given of the simple
loyalty of sea-faring men which in their descendants has
served us so well of late. 'The truth is,' continues Pepys,
'Sir Christopher Mings was a very stout man, and a man
of great parts, and most excellent tongue among ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>men.... He had brought his family into a way of being great;
but dying at this time, his memory and name ... will be quite
forgot in a few months as if he had never been, nor any of
his name be the better by it; he having not had time to will
any estate, but is dead poor rather than rich.' A writer who
could describe such a scene in a style which comes so near
distinction, and could then reflect with dignity upon the
swift passing of human greatness, is something more than
a 'delightful old Diarist' or a 'garrulous gossip'; but it is
characteristic of Pepys that he should thus conclude his
entry for the day: 'In my way home I called on a fisherman
and bought three eeles, which cost me three shillings.'</p>

<p>I have quoted this passage about the funeral of Sir Christopher
Myngs for another reason—it enables us to understand
how Pepys developed later on so impressive an official style.
He takes pleasure in long, labyrinthine sentences, in which
the thread of thought winds deviously through an infinity of
dependent clauses, but the thread is never lost, and the reader
always arrives in the end at the destined goal. He has a discriminating
taste in the selection of words, always choosing
the more impressive, and leaving the reader with the sense
of something dignified moving before him, like a procession,
but never sacrificing clearness and precision to mere sound.
Yet associated with all this pomp is a sense of humour,
usually full-flavoured, but on occasion as subtle and delicate
as need be<a name="Anchor-27" id="Anchor-27"></a><a href="#Footnote-27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a>, and finding its way even into the more dismal
kinds of official correspondence.</p>

<p>To illustrate the point of complexity, let me read you a
letter to the Navy Board of 2 June, 1677, which I came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>across not long ago among the Pepysian papers<a name="Anchor-28" id="Anchor-28"></a><a href="#Footnote-28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a>. It consists
of a single colossal sentence, yet the meaning is perfectly
clear. If you want a parallel, you should go to the Prayer
Book, to the Exhortation which precedes the General Confession;
for this, although punctuated as three sentences, is
structurally only one.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There being a prospect (as you will know) of a considerable number
of great ships to be built, and many applications being already, and
more likely to be yet made to his Majesty and my Lords of the Admiralty
for employments by persons so far from having merited the same
by any past service as to be wholly strangers to the business thereof,
or at least have their qualifications for the same wholly unknown, nor
have any title to his Majesty's favour therein more than their interest
(which possibly they have bought too) in the persons they solicit by,
And knowing that it is his Majesty's royal intentions, as well as for the
benefit of his service, that the employments arising upon his ships be
disposed to such as by their long and faithful services and experiences
are best fitted for and deserve the same, I make it my desire to you
that you will at your first convenience cause the list of the present
standing officers of his Majesty's fleet, namely, pursers, boatswains, and
carpenters, to be overlooked, and a collection thence made of such as
by length of service, frequency and strictness of passing their accounts,
together with their diligence and sobriety, you shall find most deserving
to be advanced from lesser ships to bigger, transmitting the same to
me in order to my laying it (as there shall be occasion) before his
Majesty for the benefit of the persons you shall therein do right to and
encouragement of others to imitate them in deserving well in his service,
Towards the obtaining of which I shall by the grace of God endeavour
constantly to do my part, as I doubt not you will also do yours, putting
in execution the Lord Admiral's instructions for informing yourselves
well in the good and bad behaviour of these officers, and particularly
by your enquiries after the same at pays, when by the presence of the
ship's companies the same will most probably be understood.</p></div>

<p>The reputation of Samuel Pepys has suffered in two ways.
Readers of the <cite>Diary</cite> under-estimate him because they conceive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>of him as a diarist only, and do not realize the seriousness
of his public responsibilities or the greatness of his
official career. On the other hand, naval historians have
often under-estimated him because they have failed to appreciate
the difficulties with which he had to contend. If these
difficulties are allowed for, the services rendered by Samuel
Pepys to the navy are incomparable. He stood for a vigorous
shipbuilding policy, for methodical organisation in every
department, and for the restoration of a lost naval discipline.
This was recognised by his immediate posterity, and in the
century after his death a great tradition grew up about his
name. A commission which reported in 1805 spoke of him
as 'a man of extraordinary knowledge in all that related to
the business' of the navy, 'of great talents, and the most
indefatigable industry.' The respect paid to his authority
by the generation of naval administrators which succeeded
his own—comparable only perhaps to the weight which
Lord Chief Justice Coke had carried among the lawyers of
an earlier time—led to a number of transcripts being made
from the Pepysian manuscripts and preserved in the Admiralty
Library for the guidance of his successors. And this
tradition has to be reconciled with the other and widely
different tradition associated with the Pepys of the <cite>Diary</cite>.</p>

<p>It is not easy to realise that the two traditions belong to
the same person. It is extraordinary that a man should
have written the <cite>Diary</cite>, but it is much more extraordinary
that the man who wrote the <cite>Diary</cite> should also have been
'the right hand of the navy.' From the <cite>Diary</cite> we learn that
Pepys was a musician, a dandy, a collector of books and
prints, an observer of boundless curiosity, and, as a critic
has pointed out, one who possessed an 'amazing zest for
life.' From the Pepysian manuscripts we learn that he was
a man of sound judgment, of orderly and methodical business
habits, of great administrative capacity and energy;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>and that he possessed extraordinary shrewdness and tact in
dealing with men. At certain points in the <cite>Diary</cite> we can
see the great official maturing, but in the main the intimate
self-revelation of a human being seems far removed from
official life. It is the combination of qualities that is so
astounding, and those who regard Pepys only as 'the most
amusing and capable of our seventeenth century diarists'<a name="Anchor-29" id="Anchor-29"></a><a href="#Footnote-29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a>—a
mere literary performer making sport for us—do little
justice to a great career.</p>

<h2>LECTURE <abbr title="2">II</abbr><br />

<small>ADMINISTRATION</small></h2>


<p>The history of naval administration between the Restoration
and the Revolution falls naturally into four periods:
(1) 1660-73, from the appointment of the Duke of York to
be Lord High Admiral, until his retirement after the passing
of the Test Act; (2) 1673-79, the first Secretaryship of
Samuel Pepys; (3) 1679-84, the period of administrative
disorder which followed his resignation; and (4) 1684-88,
from the return of the Duke of York to office until the
Revolution—this period being also that of Pepys's second
Secretaryship.</p>

<p>At the date of the King's Restoration the direction of
the navy was in the hands of an Admiralty Commission of
twenty-eight, appointed by the restored Rump Parliament
in December, 1659<a name="Anchor-30" id="Anchor-30"></a><a href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a>, with a Navy Board of seven experts
under it. One of the earlier acts of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> on his return
was to dissolve these two bodies, and to revive the ancient
form of navy government by a Lord High Admiral and
four Principal Officers—the Treasurer, the Comptroller, the
Surveyor, and the Clerk of the Acts. James, Duke of York,
the King's brother, afterwards James <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, was made Lord
High Admiral—an appointment which realised the ideas of
Monson, who had written earlier: 'The way to settle things is
to appoint an Admiral, young, heroical, and of a great blood.
His experience in sea affairs is not so much to be required
at first as his sincerity, honour, and wisdom; for his daily
practice in his Office, with conference of able and experienced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>men, will quickly instruct him.'<a name="Anchor-31" id="Anchor-31"></a><a href="#Footnote-31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a> All the Stuarts were interested
in the sea. Nothing gave Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> more pleasure
than to sail down the Thames in one of his yachts to inspect
his ships, and his brother possessed something like an expert
knowledge of naval affairs. Even Macaulay, who has
scarcely a good word to say for him, allows that he would
have made 'a respectable clerk in the dockyard at Chatham.'<a name="Anchor-32" id="Anchor-32"></a><a href="#Footnote-32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a>
He was an authority on shipbuilding questions<a name="Anchor-33" id="Anchor-33"></a><a href="#Footnote-33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a>, and Pepys,
in a private minute not intended for publication and therefore
likely to express his real mind, ascribes much of the
strength of the navy in his day to the Duke's energy in
'getting ships to be begun to be built, in confidence that
when they were begun they would not let them want finishing,
who otherwise would never of themselves have spared
money from lesser uses to begin to build.'<a name="Anchor-34" id="Anchor-34"></a><a href="#Footnote-34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> He was also by
temperament stiff in discipline, and threw his influence
strongly on the side of reform. The numerous references to
him in the State Papers shew that while he was Lord High
Admiral he bestowed a great deal of attention upon the
duties of the office<a name="Anchor-35" id="Anchor-35"></a><a href="#Footnote-35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a>.</p>

<p>The new Treasurer of the Navy was Sir George Carteret,
who, entering the service as a boy, had risen to high command
in the navy, and had served as Comptroller in the
reign of Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>. 'Besides his other parts of honesty and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>discretion,' says Clarendon, he was 'undoubtedly as good, if
not the best, seaman in England,'<a name="Anchor-36" id="Anchor-36"></a><a href="#Footnote-36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> and Sir William Coventry,
his consistent opponent, described him to Pepys as 'a man
that do take the most pains, and gives himself the most to
do business of any about the Court, without any desire of
pleasure or divertisements.'<a name="Anchor-37" id="Anchor-37"></a><a href="#Footnote-37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> Pepys himself wrote of him
not long before his fall: 'I do take' him 'for a most honest
man.'<a name="Anchor-38" id="Anchor-38"></a><a href="#Footnote-38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a></p>

<p>Sir Robert Slyngesbie, the new Comptroller, was himself
the son of a Comptroller of the Navy, and had served as a
sea-captain as early as 1633<a name="Anchor-39" id="Anchor-39"></a><a href="#Footnote-39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a>, having been 'from his infancy
bred up and employed in the navy.'<a name="Anchor-40" id="Anchor-40"></a><a href="#Footnote-40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a></p>

<p>Sir William Batten, the Surveyor, was only returning to
an office which he had already held, for he had been Surveyor
of the Navy from 1638 to 1642, and afterwards an
active naval commander. Pepys began by borrowing £40 of
him<a name="Anchor-41" id="Anchor-41"></a><a href="#Footnote-41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a>, and then came to dislike him. Their relations were
not improved by the small social jealousies which broke out
between their wives. Lady Batten complained to Pepys
that 'there was not the neighbourliness between her' and
Mrs Pepys 'that was fit to be'; that Mrs Pepys spoke 'unhandsomely
of her,' and her maid 'mocked her' over the
garden wall<a name="Anchor-42" id="Anchor-42"></a><a href="#Footnote-42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a>. Soon after, Pepys records with some satisfaction
that he and his wife managed to take precedence of
Lady Batten in going out of church, 'which I believe will
vex her.'<a name="Anchor-43" id="Anchor-43"></a><a href="#Footnote-43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a> What the <cite>Diary</cite> calls a 'fray' eventually took
place between the two ladies, and Lady Batten was 'mighty
high upon it,' telling Mrs Pepys's 'boy' that 'she would
teach his mistress better manners, which my wife answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>aloud that she might hear, that she could learn little manners
of her.'<a name="Anchor-44" id="Anchor-44"></a><a href="#Footnote-44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a> Pepys came to the conclusion that his wife
was to blame<a name="Anchor-45" id="Anchor-45"></a><a href="#Footnote-45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a>. Sir William Batten, who does not deserve
the treatment he meets with in the <cite>Diary</cite>, had at first
done what he could to accommodate the quarrel, saying to
Pepys that 'he desired the difference between our wives
might not make a difference between us,'<a name="Anchor-46" id="Anchor-46"></a><a href="#Footnote-46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a> but quarrels of
this kind are the hardest of all to compose, and it is not to
the <cite>Diary</cite> that Batten's biographer goes for his facts. Pepys
calls him a knave<a name="Anchor-47" id="Anchor-47"></a><a href="#Footnote-47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a> and a sot<a name="Anchor-48" id="Anchor-48"></a><a href="#Footnote-48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a>, and accuses him of 'corruption
and underhand dealing'<a name="Anchor-49" id="Anchor-49"></a><a href="#Footnote-49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a>; and in reviewing his own position
on the last day of the year 1663, he writes: 'At the Office
I am well, though envied to the devil by Sir William Batten,
who hates me to death, but cannot hurt me. The rest either
love me, or at least do not shew otherwise....' The news of
Batten's last illness was, however, received with some sign
of relenting. 'Word is brought me that he is so ill that it is
believed he cannot live till to-morrow, which troubles me
and my wife mightily, partly out of kindness, he being
a good neighbour—and partly because of the money he
owes me upon our bargain of the late prize.'<a name="Anchor-50" id="Anchor-50"></a><a href="#Footnote-50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a></p>

<p>The only one of the Principal Officers who knew nothing
about the navy was the Clerk of the Acts, Samuel Pepys
himself. He obtained the office by the influence of his
patron, Edward Mountagu, the first Earl of Sandwich, a
distinguished naval commander, who was first cousin to
Pepys's father and recognised the claims of kinship after the
fashion of his day. It was necessary first to buy out Thomas
Barlow, who had been Clerk of the Acts under Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>, and
Pepys, observing that he was 'an old, consumptive man,'<a name="Anchor-51" id="Anchor-51"></a><a href="#Footnote-51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>offered him £100 a year. He lived until 1665, and then a
characteristic entry appears in the <cite>Diary</cite>. 'At noon home
to dinner, and then to my office again, where Sir William
Petty comes among other things to tell me that Mr Barlow
is dead; for which, God knows my heart, I could be as sorry
as is possible for one to be for a stranger by whose death
he gets £100 per annum, he being a worthy, honest man;
but after having considered that, when I come to consider
the providence of God by this means unexpectedly to give
me £100 a year more in my estate, I have cause to bless
God, and do it from the bottom of my heart.'<a name="Anchor-52" id="Anchor-52"></a><a href="#Footnote-52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a></p>

<p>Besides the four Principal Officers, the new Navy Board
also included three extra Commissioners of the Navy, Lord
Berkeley, Sir William Penn, and Peter Pett. Lord Berkeley
was a distinguished soldier, who had won great honour at
Stratton, and had served under Turenne from 1652 to 1655<a name="Anchor-53" id="Anchor-53"></a><a href="#Footnote-53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a>.
Sir William Penn was the son of a seaman and had been a
seaman all his life. He had been rear-admiral and then
vice-admiral in the time of the Long Parliament; he had
served as vice-admiral under Blake, had commanded the
expedition which seized Jamaica<a name="Anchor-54" id="Anchor-54"></a><a href="#Footnote-54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a>, and had been a member
of two Admiralty Commissions during the Interregnum<a name="Anchor-55" id="Anchor-55"></a><a href="#Footnote-55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a>.
Peter Pett came of a famous family of shipbuilders<a name="Anchor-56" id="Anchor-56"></a><a href="#Footnote-56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a>—an
earlier Pett had been master shipwright at Deptford in the
reign of Edward <abbr title="the sixth">VI</abbr><a name="Anchor-57" id="Anchor-57"></a><a href="#Footnote-57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a>—and he had already served as resident
Commissioner at Chatham for thirteen years<a name="Anchor-58" id="Anchor-58"></a><a href="#Footnote-58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a>. Pett occupied
a somewhat inferior position to his colleagues, as he was
required still to reside at Chatham to take charge of the
dockyard there—at this time the most important of the royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>yards, described in the <cite>Admiralty Letters</cite> as 'the master-yard
of all the rest.'<a name="Anchor-59" id="Anchor-59"></a><a href="#Footnote-59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a> The other two Commissioners had no
special duties assigned to them, and this was regarded as
one of the advantages of the system now established, since
they were 'not limited to any, and yet furnished with powers
of acting and controlling every part, both of the particular
and common duties of the Office' ... 'understanding the
defects of the whole, and applying their assistance where it
may be most useful.'<a name="Anchor-60" id="Anchor-60"></a><a href="#Footnote-60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that on the Navy Board of the
Restoration expert experience was overwhelmingly represented.
Of its seven members four were seamen; one a
soldier—and it must be remembered that at this time the
line between the two services was not distinctly drawn, for
Blake had been a lieutenant-colonel and Monck commander-in-chief
of an army before they were appointed to command
fleets as 'generals-at-sea'; one represented experience of
shipbuilding and dockyard administration; and only the
Clerk of the Acts knew nothing about the sea. Sir Walter
Ralegh had remarked in his day: 'It were to be wished
that the chief officers under the Lord Admiral ... should be
men of the best experience in sea-service,' and had complained
that sometimes 'by the special favour of princes'
or 'the mediation of great men for the preferment of their
servants,' or 'now and then by virtue of the purse,' persons
'very raw and ignorant' are 'very unworthily and unfitly
nominated to those places.'<a name="Anchor-61" id="Anchor-61"></a><a href="#Footnote-61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a> But such criticisms applied no
longer. The King had made a good choice of fit persons
duly qualified, and had established a naval administration
which, if it failed, would not fail for lack of knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>There were a good many subsequent changes, but the
importance of administration by experts was not again lost
sight of. The office of Treasurer of the Navy soon fell to
the men of accounts, and in 1667 Sir George Carteret was
succeeded by the Earl of Anglesey, a 'laborious, skilful,
cautious, moderate' official, who had had seven years' experience
of finance as Vice-Treasurer and Receiver-General
for Ireland<a name="Anchor-62" id="Anchor-62"></a><a href="#Footnote-62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a>. But with this exception, if the post of a Principal
Officer was vacated by a naval expert it was offered
to a naval expert again. When Sir Robert Slyngesbie, the
Comptroller, died in 1661<a name="Anchor-63" id="Anchor-63"></a><a href="#Footnote-63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a>, he was succeeded by Sir John
Mennes, who had served under Sir William Monson in the
Narrow Seas, and had had a wide experience of the navy<a name="Anchor-64" id="Anchor-64"></a><a href="#Footnote-64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a>.
This appointment was not as successful as might have been
expected. Pepys thought him 'most excellent pleasant company'<a name="Anchor-65" id="Anchor-65"></a><a href="#Footnote-65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a>
and 'a very good, harmless, honest gentleman,'<a name="Anchor-66" id="Anchor-66"></a><a href="#Footnote-66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a> but
he is always attacking his incapacity<a name="Anchor-67" id="Anchor-67"></a><a href="#Footnote-67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a>, and refers to him on
one occasion as a 'doating fool.'<a name="Anchor-68" id="Anchor-68"></a><a href="#Footnote-68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a> On his death in 1671 the
office passed to Sir Thomas Allin, originally a shipowner at
Lowestoft, who had served under Prince Rupert, and had
acquired a reputation in the Second Dutch War<a name="Anchor-69" id="Anchor-69"></a><a href="#Footnote-69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a>. When
Sir William Batten, the Surveyor, died in 1667, he was succeeded
by Colonel Thomas Middleton, who had been resident
Commissioner at Portsmouth<a name="Anchor-70" id="Anchor-70"></a><a href="#Footnote-70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a>; and when in 1672 Middleton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>was transferred to Chatham, John Tippetts, who had followed
him at Portsmouth, was appointed to the Surveyorship<a name="Anchor-71" id="Anchor-71"></a><a href="#Footnote-71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a>.
It should be noticed that whereas during the thirteen
years of naval history from 1660 to 1673 the office of Treasurer
of the Navy was held by four different persons, and the
offices of Comptroller and Surveyor each by three, there was
no change in the office of Clerk of the Acts. Pepys was
the only one of the Principal Officers whose experience
was continuous.</p>

<p>The extra Commissionerships, when vacancies arose, did
not all go to naval experts, but men of ability were selected
for them, and sometimes men of distinction. When in 1662
another extra Commissioner was appointed, the choice fell
on William Coventry, a civilian; but Coventry had already
had two years' experience of naval administration as Secretary
to the Lord High Admiral, and his ability soon made
him one of the most valuable members of the Navy Board.
Burnet described him in 1665 as 'a man of great actions
and eminent virtues'; Temple credits him with high political
capacity; Evelyn calls him 'a wise and witty gentleman'<a name="Anchor-72" id="Anchor-72"></a><a href="#Footnote-72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a>;
and the <cite>Diary</cite> shews how warmly Pepys was attached to
him<a name="Anchor-73" id="Anchor-73"></a><a href="#Footnote-73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a>. In 1664 an extra Commissionership was conferred
on Lord Brouncker, a literary man, an intimate friend of
Evelyn's, and the first President of the Royal Society, who
took something more than an amateur's interest in shipbuilding,
and in 1662 had built a yacht for the King<a name="Anchor-74" id="Anchor-74"></a><a href="#Footnote-74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a>. Pepys could
not make up his mind about him; for in 1667 he speaks of
him as 'a rotten-hearted, false man as any else I know, even
as Sir W. Penn himself, and therefore I must beware of him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>accordingly, and I hope I shall,'<a name="Anchor-75" id="Anchor-75"></a><a href="#Footnote-75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a> and in 1668 he regards
him as the best man in the Navy Office<a name="Anchor-76" id="Anchor-76"></a><a href="#Footnote-76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a>. One of the extra
Commissioners, Sir Edward Seymour, was also Speaker of
the House of Commons.</p>

<p>The Navy Board was by tradition the Lord High Admiral's
council of advice for that part of his office which
was concerned with the government of the navy, and Monson
alludes to its members as 'the conduit pipes to whom the
Lord Admiral properly directs all his commands for his
Majesty's service, and from whom it descends to all other
inferior officers and ministers under them whatsoever.'<a name="Anchor-77" id="Anchor-77"></a><a href="#Footnote-77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> In
practice the Board enjoyed very large administrative powers,
for it was authorised 'to cause all ordinary businesses to be
done according to the ancient and allowed practice of the
Office, and extraordinary according to the warrants and
directions from the Lord Admiral and the State'<a name="Anchor-78" id="Anchor-78"></a><a href="#Footnote-78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a>; but in
theory it existed only in order to carry out the general instructions
which the Duke of York had issued early in 1662<a name="Anchor-79" id="Anchor-79"></a><a href="#Footnote-79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a>,
not long after he had taken office. These were drawn in
comprehensive terms, and of necessity left a vast number of
decisions on particular questions to be taken by the Board.
These instructions of 1662 remained in force until the
Admiralty was reorganised at the beginning of the 19th
century<a name="Anchor-80" id="Anchor-80"></a><a href="#Footnote-80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a>.</p>

<p>It is evident that the administration of the navy after the
Restoration was in the hands of able and experienced men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>and that they were acting under instructions which were
good enough to survive without material alteration for
another century and a half. Yet there is abundant evidence
in the Pepysian manuscripts and elsewhere to shew that
naval administration during the period 1660-1673 was in
the main a disastrous failure. The reason why the collapse
was so complete was the pressure of the Second Dutch War
upon the resources of the naval administration, but the
essential causes lay deeper than external events. First and
foremost undoubtedly stands the problem of finance. The
want of money was the root of all evil in the Stuart navy.
I propose to deal fully with this problem in my next lecture,
and will only ask you to note its existence now. But there
was more than this. On 15 August, 1666, Pepys made a remarkable
entry in the <cite>Diary</cite> which I think gives the key to
the situation: 'Thence walked over the Park with Sir W.
Coventry, in our way talking of the unhappy state of our
Office; and I took an opportunity to let him know, that
though the backwardnesses of all our matters of the Office
may be well imputed to the known want of money, yet perhaps
there might be personal and particular failings.' He
then notes Coventry's reply, which indicates the way in
which personal failings were themselves affected by want of
money. 'Nor, indeed, says he, is there room now-a-days to
find fault with any particular man, while we are in this condition
for money.' The whole service was breathing the
miasmas exhaled by a corrupt Court. Slackness was fashionable
because the King was slack, and the higher naval
administration had to contend with idleness and dishonesty
in the lower ranks of the service due to a relaxation of the
standards of public and private duty. In this conflict it was
at a serious disadvantage, for it was impossible effectively to
control subordinates whom there was no money to pay. The
members of the Navy Board were capable and experienced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>and their intentions were excellent, but the atmosphere
was poisonous and the situation beyond control. 'Personal
and particular failings' in combination with financial
disorder ruined the Navy Office, as they would have
ruined any public department in any country and at any
time.</p>

<p>It would be idle to pretend that the Restoration officials
conformed to modern standards of official purity; although
they were very much better than the corrupt administrators
of the reign of James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>. Pepys is convicted on his own
confession of a good deal that would be unthinkable to-day.
During the period of the <cite>Diary</cite> his salary as Clerk of the
Acts was £350 a year; while in 1665 he was appointed
Treasurer of the Tangier Commission, and from 1665 to
1667 he was Surveyor-General of Victualling with an additional
£300 a year<a name="Anchor-81" id="Anchor-81"></a><a href="#Footnote-81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a>. His salary as Secretary of the Admiralty
was £500 a year, but he only enjoyed this for two periods
amounting altogether to ten years. Yet as early as May,
1667, he was worth £6900<a name="Anchor-82" id="Anchor-82"></a><a href="#Footnote-82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a>; and in the end he retired on
a competence, and was able to indulge the expensive tastes
of the collector. It is evident that his legitimate emoluments
must have been supplemented in other ways. Readers of
the <cite>Diary</cite> will remember that on 2 February, 1664, he received
from Sir William Warren, the timber merchant, 'a
pair of gloves' for his wife 'wrapt up in paper,' which he
'would not open, feeling it hard'; this phenomenon being
due to the presence, presumably in the fingers, of 'forty
pieces in good gold.' Warren gave him many other presents,
and shewed himself 'a most useful and thankful man,'<a name="Anchor-83" id="Anchor-83"></a><a href="#Footnote-83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a>
bringing him on one occasion £100 'in a bag,' which Pepys
'joyfully' carried home in a coach, Warren himself 'expressly
taking care that nobody might see this business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>done.'<a name="Anchor-84" id="Anchor-84"></a><a href="#Footnote-84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a> On another occasion Captain Grove gave him money
in a paper which Pepys did not open till he reached his
office, taking the precaution of 'not looking into it till all
the money was out, that I might say I saw no money in the
paper if ever I should be questioned about it.'<a name="Anchor-85" id="Anchor-85"></a><a href="#Footnote-85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a> He appears
to have profited largely by his transactions with Gauden,
the Victualler of the Navy<a name="Anchor-86" id="Anchor-86"></a><a href="#Footnote-86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a>; with the Victuallers for Tangier<a name="Anchor-87" id="Anchor-87"></a><a href="#Footnote-87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a>;
and with Captain Cocke, a contractor for hemp<a name="Anchor-88" id="Anchor-88"></a><a href="#Footnote-88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a>. He
also made profits out of flags<a name="Anchor-89" id="Anchor-89"></a><a href="#Footnote-89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a>, prizes<a name="Anchor-90" id="Anchor-90"></a><a href="#Footnote-90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a>, and Tangier freights<a name="Anchor-91" id="Anchor-91"></a><a href="#Footnote-91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a>;
and the <cite>Diary</cite> records other gifts of money and plate<a name="Anchor-92" id="Anchor-92"></a><a href="#Footnote-92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a>, including
'a noble silver warming-pan.'<a name="Anchor-93" id="Anchor-93"></a><a href="#Footnote-93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a> On the other hand,
the official letters, numbering thousands, conspire to produce
by a series of delicate impressions the conviction in the
mind of the reader that Pepys was immensely proud of the
navy, and keenly anxious for its efficiency and success. His
attitude is affected by his fundamental Puritanism, and in
the <cite>Diary</cite> he is always trying to justify to himself the presents
which he accepted. He was glad to do the giver a
good turn when he could, but it was with the proviso that
it should be 'without wrong to the King's service.'<a name="Anchor-94" id="Anchor-94"></a><a href="#Footnote-94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a> The
inventor of such a phrase is on dangerous ground, but he is
not yet utterly debased; and the high responsibility of his
later life may very well have served as an antiseptic to arrest
corruption before it had gone far. At any rate, this is as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>much in advance of the cynical greed of the earlier administrators
as it is behind the contempt for all forms of corruption
which is natural to well-paid officials educated to
modern standards.</p>


<p class="mt2">In 1673 the Test Act drove the Duke of York from
office, and brought about other important changes in the
administration of the navy. The King retained in his own
hands the Lord High Admiral's patronage and also the
Admiralty dues, which were to be collected for his 'only
use and behoof'; but the rest of his functions were placed
in commission<a name="Anchor-95" id="Anchor-95"></a><a href="#Footnote-95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a>. There were twelve Commissioners, of whom
no less than five—the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Treasurer,
the Lord Privy Seal, and two Principal Secretaries—were
great officers of State. Prince Rupert was at the head of
the Commission, and Samuel Pepys was appointed Secretary,
while the Duke of York, although no longer in office,
remained, in spite of the Test Act, an important influence
in naval affairs<a name="Anchor-96" id="Anchor-96"></a><a href="#Footnote-96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a>. Pepys was succeeded in the office of Clerk
of the Acts by his brother, John Pepys, and his clerk, Thomas
Hayter, acting jointly. There were also changes in the composition
of the Navy Board, but these did not affect its
character as a body of naval experts.</p>

<p>The chief business of the new administrators was to bring
to a close the Third Dutch War, and then to repair, by an
energetic shipbuilding policy, that depreciation of the navy
which was the natural result of the war. In this work they
were on the whole successful. The Admiralty Commissioners
were sensible and vigilant, and they were remarkably well
served by their Secretary; while the Navy Board was strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>on the technical side of its work, and fortunate in having as
one of its members an official so thoroughly capable in his
own department as the great shipbuilder, Sir Anthony
Deane. Moreover, although the financial difficulty continued
to hamper and cripple the navy, a vigorous shipbuilding
policy was made possible by the better support which Parliament
now gave to naval expansion. The idea of the
importance of sea power had already acquired a considerable
hold upon the political classes, and the wars with the Dutch
had served to strengthen it. Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> had read rightly the
feeling of his subjects when he allowed his Chancellor to say
to the Pension Parliament in the speech which opened its
eleventh session: 'There is not so lawful or commendable
a jealousy in the world as an Englishman's of the growing
greatness of any Prince at sea.'<a name="Anchor-97" id="Anchor-97"></a><a href="#Footnote-97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a> Thus the most important
achievement of the period 1673-79 was the Act of 1677—the
17th century equivalent of a modern Naval Defence
Act—for the building of 30 new ships. Pepys, now a member
of Parliament, made in support of it a comprehensive
and vigorous speech<a name="Anchor-98" id="Anchor-98"></a><a href="#Footnote-98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a>, and he modestly attributed the adoption
of the scheme to the impression this produced upon
the House. 'I doubt not,' he writes to the Navy Board, on
23 February, 1677, 'but ere this you may have heard the
issue of this morning's debates in the House of Commons
touching the navy, wherein I thank God the account they
received from me of the past and present state thereof, compared
first with one another and then with the naval force
of our neighbours as it now is, different from what it ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>heretofore has been, was so received as that the debates
arising therefrom terminated in a vote for the supplying his
Majesty with a sum of money for building ships....'<a name="Anchor-99" id="Anchor-99"></a><a href="#Footnote-99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a> The
rates and tonnage of the 30 new ships thus provided for are
specified in the Act<a name="Anchor-100" id="Anchor-100"></a><a href="#Footnote-100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a>.</p>

<p>The new programme was pushed forward with the utmost
energy, but before it was completed the control of the navy
again changed hands. In 1679 the excitement of the Popish
Plot drove the Duke of York from England, and Pepys was
involved in his disgrace. He was accused of conspiring with
Sir Anthony Deane to send information about the navy to
the French Government and to extirpate the Protestant
religion; and was committed to the Tower on the Speaker's
warrant<a name="Anchor-101" id="Anchor-101"></a><a href="#Footnote-101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a>. His office at the Admiralty was, however, vacated
by what was in form a voluntary resignation<a name="Anchor-102" id="Anchor-102"></a><a href="#Footnote-102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a>.</p>


<p class="mt2">On the withdrawal of the Duke of York and the resignation
of Pepys, the higher administration of the navy passed
to a new Admiralty Commission of seven, who claimed and
enjoyed, in addition to the powers of the previous Commission,
those other prerogatives which the King had hitherto
reserved to himself<a name="Anchor-103" id="Anchor-103"></a><a href="#Footnote-103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a>. But although they had more power
than their predecessors, they were much less competent to
use it, for they were almost entirely without naval experience.
Sir Henry Capel, the First Commissioner, had nothing to do
with the navy until his appointment<a name="Anchor-104" id="Anchor-104"></a><a href="#Footnote-104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a>. The same can be said
of Daniel Finch, who, although he became famous afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>as Earl of Nottingham, was at this time only a young
politician just beginning his official life<a name="Anchor-105" id="Anchor-105"></a><a href="#Footnote-105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a>. Sir Thomas Lee's
reputation was that of a parliamentary debater<a name="Anchor-106" id="Anchor-106"></a><a href="#Footnote-106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a>; and the
other names are not notable. The Commission represents
an intrusion of politicians into a sphere where they were
quite out of place. The introduction of Lord Brouncker in
1681 was a step in the right direction, although he was not a
professional seaman; and other improvements were effected
in 1682, but they came too late. The Navy Board was still
composed of experts, but they could not stop the mischief
wrought by the incompetent authority under which they had
to act. The Commissioners did not find a lenient critic in
Pepys, and his comment upon them is worth quoting because
it contains a shrewd appreciation of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>. 'No king,'
he wrote in his private <cite>Minute Book</cite>, 'ever did so unaccountable
a thing to oblige his people by, as to dissolve a Commission
of the Admiralty then in his own hand, who best
understands the business of the sea of any prince the world
ever had, and things never better done, and put it into hands
which he knew were wholly ignorant thereof, sporting himself
with their ignorance.'<a name="Anchor-107" id="Anchor-107"></a><a href="#Footnote-107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> The last phrase brings before us
vividly the King's characteristic way.</p>

<p>The result that followed was inevitable. The dockyards
were disorganised; the effective force of the fleet was reduced;
the reserve of stores was depleted. The Commissioners
adopted a wasteful policy of retrenchment at all
costs. Pepys writes of 'the effects of inexperience, daily
discovering themselves' in the conduct of the Commission<a name="Anchor-108" id="Anchor-108"></a><a href="#Footnote-108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a>;
of 'general and habitual supineness, wastefulness, and neglect
of order universally spread through' the whole navy<a name="Anchor-109" id="Anchor-109"></a><a href="#Footnote-109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a>, so
that 'whereas peace used evermore to be improved to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>making up the wasteful effects of war, this appears ... to have
brought the navy into a state more deplorable in its ships
and less relievable from its stores than can be shewn to have
happened at the close of the most expenseful war.'<a name="Anchor-110" id="Anchor-110"></a><a href="#Footnote-110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a> His
indictment is supported by a formidable array of facts and
figures, and as Macaulay points out<a name="Anchor-111" id="Anchor-111"></a><a href="#Footnote-111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a>, is confirmed by a
report from an expert of the French Admiralty, so it cannot
be dismissed as mere denunciation inspired by a natural
prejudice against the men who had displaced him.</p>

<p>Things were so bad that in 1684 the Commission was
revoked, and from this date until his death the office of Lord
High Admiral was once more executed by the King, with
the advice and assistance of 'his royal brother the Duke of
York'<a name="Anchor-112" id="Anchor-112"></a><a href="#Footnote-112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 112.">[112]</a>; and on his accession James <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> became his own
Lord High Admiral. The office of Secretary of the Admiralty
was revived, and Pepys was appointed thereto; and the
government of the navy remained in the same hands until
the Revolution.</p>

<p>The important episode of the period 1684-1688 is the
appointment of the Special Commission of 1686 for the
regeneration of the navy—an experiment in organisation
for which Pepys was largely responsible<a name="Anchor-113" id="Anchor-113"></a><a href="#Footnote-113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 113.">[113]</a>. A sum of £400,000
a year was to be assigned to the navy<a name="Anchor-114" id="Anchor-114"></a><a href="#Footnote-114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a>, and this was to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>administered by a body of experts, on which the two most
important figures were Sir Anthony Deane, the great shipbuilder,
and Sir John Narbrough, the hero of the war with
Algiers. The Commission was intended to last for a term of
three years, the time estimated to be necessary for putting
the navy into a state of thorough repair, but its work was
performed with such energy and efficiency that the Commission
was dissolved in October, 1688, after only 2½ years
tenure of office, and the system of government by Principal
Officers and Commissioners of the Navy acting under the
Lord High Admiral was restored.</p>

<p>The way in which Pepys manœuvred Sir Anthony Deane
on to the Commission deserves a passing notice. It was not
an easy matter, as Deane replied to a flattering overture by
pointing out that his ordinary business as a shipwright was
bringing in to him 'more than double the benefit ... the common
wages of a Commissioner of the Navy amounts to,' and
moreover he was fifteen in family, 'and not without expectation
of more.'<a name="Anchor-115" id="Anchor-115"></a><a href="#Footnote-115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a> Pepys was then directed by James <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> to
make a list of all the notable shipbuilders in England, one
of whom might be selected as an alternative to Deane. The
result was a very libellous and tendencious document<a name="Anchor-116" id="Anchor-116"></a><a href="#Footnote-116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a>.
Sir John Tippetts was dismissed because 'his age and infirmities
arising from the gout (keeping him generally within
doors, or at least incapable of any great action abroad) would
render him wholly unable to go through the fatigue of the
work designed for Sir Anthony Deane.' The second candidate,
Sir Phineas Pett, is briefly dismissed with the words
'In every respect as the first.' Another candidate 'never
built a ship in his life ... he is also full of the gout, and by consequence
as little capable as the former of the fatigue before
mentioned.' Another is 'illiterate ... low-spirited, of little appearance
or authority'; his father 'a great drinker, and since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>killed with it.' Mr Lawrence, the master shipwright at Woolwich,
is 'a low-spirited, slow, and gouty man ... illiterate and
supine to the last degree.' Another is 'an ingenious young
man, but said rarely to have handled a tool in his life'—a mere
draughtsman. Another 'is one that loves his ease, as having
been ever used to it, not knowing what it is to work or take
pains ... and very debauched.' Another is 'a good and painful,
but very plain and illiterate man; a Phanatick; of no
authority and countenance.' And so he goes on through an
appalling list of disqualifications, which had their intended
effect upon the King's mind; they induced 'full conviction
of the necessity of his prevailing with and satisfying Sir A.
D.'<a name="Anchor-117" id="Anchor-117"></a><a href="#Footnote-117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a> Satisfactory terms were arranged<a name="Anchor-118" id="Anchor-118"></a><a href="#Footnote-118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a>, and on Saturday,
13 March, 1686, Mr Pepys brought Sir Anthony Deane 'to
the King in the morning to kiss his hand, who declared the
same to him to his full satisfaction, and afterwards to my
Lord Treasurer at the Treasury Chamber with the same
mutual content.'<a name="Anchor-119" id="Anchor-119"></a><a href="#Footnote-119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a></p>

<p>The circumstances in which the second Secretaryship of
Samuel Pepys came to an end are part of the general history
of England, and need no repetition here. On 21 December,
1688, Pepys mentions that the King was 'a second time
withdrawn,'<a name="Anchor-120" id="Anchor-120"></a><a href="#Footnote-120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 120.">[120]</a> and on Christmas Day we find him writing to
the fleet at the bidding of the Prince of Orange<a name="Anchor-121" id="Anchor-121"></a><a href="#Footnote-121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121.">[121]</a>. He continued
to act as Secretary of the Admiralty until 20 February,
1689, but on 9 March he was directed to hand over his
papers to his successor, Phineas Bowles<a name="Anchor-122" id="Anchor-122"></a><a href="#Footnote-122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 122.">[122]</a>. He was too intimately
associated with the exiled James for the government
of the Revolution to continue him in power.</p>

<small>FINANCE</small></h2>


<p>It is scarcely a matter for surprise that those historians who
were the first to appreciate the great Puritan movement, so
long under a cloud, should have yielded to the temptation
of over-emphasizing the contrast between the vigour and
comparative purity of government during the Interregnum
and its nervelessness and corruption under the Younger
Stuarts. That some such contrast exists it is impossible to
deny. The Commonwealth navy was on the whole well
managed, and every reader of Pepys's <cite>Diary</cite> knows that he
was disposed to regret in private the administrative successes
of the treasonable times. 3 June, 1667: 'To Spring Garden,
and there eat and drank a little, and then to walk up and
down the garden, reflecting upon the bad management of
things now, compared with what it was in the late rebellious
times, when men, some for fear and some for religion,
minded their business, which none now do, by being void of
both.' Or again, 4 September, 1668: 'The business of abusing
the Puritans begins to grow stale and of no use, they being
the people that at last will be found the wisest.' But it is
possible, while dwelling upon a moral contrast, to ignore the
difference in the financial situation. The virtuous Puritan
colonels who controlled the navy under the Commonwealth
had command of large financial resources, for confiscations
and Royalist compositions were very productive, and the
governments of the Interregnum could apply to the raising
of taxes irresistible military force. As far as the compositions
went, they were, however, living upon capital, and
when this was exhausted, the pressure of financial difficulties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>soon began to be felt. The maintenance of the great professional
army came to be a burden too heavy for the
resources of the country as they stood in that day, and the
navy suffered from the competition of the army for the available
funds. The disease usually assigned to the Restoration
period declared itself before the Restoration took place, and
when the King came back he found the navy already deep
in debt. In 1659 nearly half a million was due on account
of wages alone, and the total debt must have been over
three-quarters of a million<a name="Anchor-123" id="Anchor-123"></a><a href="#Footnote-123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123.">[123]</a>. An official report of July, 1659,
estimated the outgoings at £20,000 a week, but pointed out
that 'since May 31 has not been received above £8000 a
week.'<a name="Anchor-124" id="Anchor-124"></a><a href="#Footnote-124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124.">[124]</a> It must be remembered that with 17th century
money values these figures are very much larger than they
look, and as the State had not yet invented funding debt,
and so charging it on posterity, its position was that of an
extravagant private person. Thus the naval administrators
of the Restoration were succeeding to a bankrupt estate, and
in the <cite>Diary</cite> Pepys strikes a note of despair. 31 July, 1660:
the navy 'is in very sad condition, and money must be
raised for it.' 11 June, 1661: 'now the credit of the Office
is brought so low, that none will sell us anything without
our personal security given for the same.' 31 August, 1661:
'we are at our Office quiet, only for lack of money all things
go to rack.' 30 September, 1661: 'the want of money puts
all things, and above all the Navy, out of order.' 28 June,
1662: 'God knows, the King is not able to set out five ships
at this present without great difficulty, we neither having
money, credit, nor stores.'</p>

<p>The same difficulties were felt before, during, and after the
Second Dutch War. In September, 1664, when war was impending,
Commissioner Pett tried to buy tallow and candles
for the navy at Maidstone, but found the country 'so shy'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>that they refused to deal<a name="Anchor-125" id="Anchor-125"></a><a href="#Footnote-125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125.">[125]</a>. In January, 1666, the Commissioner
at Portsmouth wrote that all men distrust London
pay<a name="Anchor-126" id="Anchor-126"></a><a href="#Footnote-126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 126.">[126]</a>. Nearly half the letters to the Navy Board calendared
for 1665-6 refer to the difficulties experienced by government
agents in obtaining supplies<a name="Anchor-127" id="Anchor-127"></a><a href="#Footnote-127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 127.">[127]</a>. In this way bargains
were lost for want of ready money<a name="Anchor-128" id="Anchor-128"></a><a href="#Footnote-128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 128.">[128]</a>, and where credit was
obtained, enormous prices had to be paid<a name="Anchor-129" id="Anchor-129"></a><a href="#Footnote-129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 129.">[129]</a>. The hardships to
private persons were intolerable. A firm of slop-sellers who
had supplied goods to the value of £24,800 during the last
two years, and had received only £800, would shortly be
ruined in their estates and families<a name="Anchor-130" id="Anchor-130"></a><a href="#Footnote-130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 130.">[130]</a>. A Bristol shipbuilder
writes: 'I have so disabled myself in the relief of poor
workmen that I am now out of a capacity of relieving
mine own family: I have disbursed and engaged for more
than I am worth.'<a name="Anchor-131" id="Anchor-131"></a><a href="#Footnote-131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 131.">[131]</a> The Barber Surgeons' Company claim
£1,496. 6<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, long unpaid, for filling medicine chests, and
complain of the opprobrious language they receive from
surgeons who can get no pay<a name="Anchor-132" id="Anchor-132"></a><a href="#Footnote-132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 132.">[132]</a>; and a certain poor widow, a
creditor of the government, is in a most deplorable condition,
without a stick of wood or coals to lay on the fire, and owing
money to about fifteen people as poor as herself, who torment
her daily<a name="Anchor-133" id="Anchor-133"></a><a href="#Footnote-133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 133.">[133]</a>.</p>

<p>The total annual charge of the navy in time of peace is
not easy to calculate. On 18 February, 1663<a name="Anchor-134" id="Anchor-134"></a><a href="#Footnote-134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 134.">[134]</a>, Pepys himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>estimated 'the true charge of the Navy,' since the King's
coming in to Christmas last, to have been 'after the rate of
£374,743 a year,' but it is not clear what this figure includes.
Perhaps the pre-war expenditure may be put at not far
short of £400,000. In a letter to Sir Philip Warwick, dated
14 March, 1666<a name="Anchor-135" id="Anchor-135"></a><a href="#Footnote-135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 135.">[135]</a>, he supplies materials for estimating expenditure
in time of war. So enormous were the arrears that
the sum of £2,312,876 would be needed to pay the fleet and
yards to 1 August, 1665, to clear off the arrears of the Victualler
and provide victuals for the current year, to finish
ten new ships that had been ordered, and to meet wear
and tear and wages for the first ten months of 1666. Towards
this the total funds available, including a Parliamentary
grant of £1,250,000 made in October, 1665, amounted
to £1,498,483. Thus there was a deficit of £814,393. But
to this would have to be added other charges not included
in the first estimate—principally wear and tear and wages
for the last two months of 1666, arrears of wages, and other
debts, which would increase the deficit to £1,277,161, over
and above 'the whole expense of the Office of the Ordnance.'
In other words, the funds available for the navy in
March, 1666, in the second year of the war, were scarcely
more than half its probable requirements<a name="Anchor-136" id="Anchor-136"></a><a href="#Footnote-136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 136.">[136]</a>. Nevertheless,
Pepys derived great consolation from a calculation which
he had made of the cost of the First Dutch War in 1653,
whereby it appeared that 'the State's charge then seems to
have exceeded the King's for the same service and time by
£171,785.'<a name="Anchor-137" id="Anchor-137"></a><a href="#Footnote-137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 137.">[137]</a> This is the justification of a note in the <cite>Diary</cite>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>of 16 March, 1669: 'Upon the whole do find that the late
times in all their management were not more husbandly than
we.' To meet the situation recourse was again had to Parliament,
and in October, 1666, the Commons voted £1,800,000,
although their suspicion that the money was being wasted
led to the appointment of that Commission of Public Accounts
which was to give Pepys and his colleagues infinite
trouble<a name="Anchor-138" id="Anchor-138"></a><a href="#Footnote-138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 138.">[138]</a>, and was to lay the foundation of Parliamentary
enquiry into the proceedings of the executive.</p>

<p>As soon as the war came to an end, the higher authorities
began to consider schemes of retrenchment in the navy. A
committee appointed 29 July, 1667, by Order in Council, to
consider the King's expenses called for a report upon the
cost of the navy, and the Duke of York put forward some
preliminary suggestions<a name="Anchor-139" id="Anchor-139"></a><a href="#Footnote-139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 139.">[139]</a>, the most important being a reduction
of certain establishments and the closing of the dockyard
at Harwich. He also suggested a reduction in the
number of the Commissioners from ten to six, or at most
seven, although he was disposed to resist any great reduction
in their salaries on the ground that these should be sufficient
to make the Principal Officers and Commissioners 'value
their employments, and not subject them to a necessity of
base compliances with others to the King's prejudice, by
which to get one shilling to himself he must lose ten to the
King, and when he shall have once subjected himself to an
inferior pleasure by such a falsehood, he never more dares
act the part of a good officer, being by his former guilt become
a slave to his inferior.' This argument, while it served
incidentally to protect Pepys's emoluments, is not a bad
statement of the case for a living wage as an antidote
to corruption. The scheme eventually adopted, suggested
by Sir William Coventry, aimed at a reduction of peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>expenditure to £200,000 a year<a name="Anchor-140" id="Anchor-140"></a><a href="#Footnote-140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 140.">[140]</a>, but the goal was never
reached, for the naval expenditure of the next two or three
years was not, as a matter of fact, limited to the £200,000
a year proposed, nor was ready money provided—an essential
condition of the scheme. The policy of retrenchment
on a great scale would have to be carried on for a long time
before it could affect the accumulated masses of the navy
debt<a name="Anchor-141" id="Anchor-141"></a><a href="#Footnote-141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 141.">[141]</a>, and there is abundant evidence of continued financial
stringency after the war as well as before it. This carried
its nemesis into the Third Dutch War. The comparative
failure of the naval operations of 1673 was due to the fact
that the fleet had been sent out insufficiently manned and
equipped; and the want of a reserve of stores and of men
and materials for refitting occasioned the loss of nearly six
weeks in the best season of the year<a name="Anchor-142" id="Anchor-142"></a><a href="#Footnote-142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 142.">[142]</a>.</p>

<p>As soon as the Third Dutch War came to an end in
February, 1674, another period of feverish retrenchment
set in, and an attempt was made 'to lessen the growing
charge in the navy, towards which no one particular seems
more to conduce than that of reducing the number of the
persons employed therein, both at sea and in the yards.'<a name="Anchor-143" id="Anchor-143"></a><a href="#Footnote-143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 143.">[143]</a>
Other economies were also practised. Ships as they came
in were paid off and laid up<a name="Anchor-144" id="Anchor-144"></a><a href="#Footnote-144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 144.">[144]</a>, and it was decided to undertake
no new works 'until his Majesty hath in some measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>got over the debt which remains to him upon the old.'<a name="Anchor-145" id="Anchor-145"></a><a href="#Footnote-145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 145.">[145]</a>
Meanwhile the official correspondence contains frequent
references to the shortness of money. For instance, in January,
1674, the <i>Swan</i> was delayed at Plymouth 'from the
unwillingness of the tradesmen to trust his Majesty further'<a name="Anchor-146" id="Anchor-146"></a><a href="#Footnote-146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 146.">[146]</a>;
and in December, 1677, Pepys reports from Sir John Kempthorne
that 'the brewer at Portsmouth doth absolutely declare
that he will not provide any beer for the <i>Rupert</i> and
<i>Centurion</i> till he is better assured of his payment than he
now is.'<a name="Anchor-147" id="Anchor-147"></a><a href="#Footnote-147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 147.">[147]</a> At the beginning of 1678 the situation was somewhat
relieved by the Parliamentary vote for preparations
against France, but this improvement was of short duration,
and in December we find Pepys referring to one of the most
wasteful consequences of a want of money—'that mighty
charge which has so long lain upon our hands for want of
money wherewith to discharge those of the ships which
remain yet unpaid off.'<a name="Anchor-148" id="Anchor-148"></a><a href="#Footnote-148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 148.">[148]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the frequent references to want of funds scattered
up and down the official correspondence, the financial
position of the navy greatly improved in the later years of
the Restoration period. At Lady Day, 1686, the debts of
the Navy Office were reckoned at £171,836. 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>—a remarkable
reduction on the enormous totals of 1666<a name="Anchor-149" id="Anchor-149"></a><a href="#Footnote-149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 149.">[149]</a>. After
the accession of James <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> no less than £305,806 was paid
by the Treasurer of the Navy on account of debts incurred
in Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>'s reign<a name="Anchor-150" id="Anchor-150"></a><a href="#Footnote-150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 150.">[150]</a>, so it is not surprising to find that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>both in the closing years of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> and the earlier years
of James <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, money was still difficult to get, and the old
complaints recur although in a less aggravated form.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind these facts about finance, let us pass on
to consider some of their practical results.</p>


<p class="mt2">During the period from 1660 to 1688 the operations of
the navy were grievously hampered by the deficiency of
men, both in the dockyards and at sea; and this deficiency
was mainly, if not entirely, due to the want of pay.</p>

<p>The state of things during the Second Dutch War was
appalling. The <cite>Diary</cite> contains pitiable stories of poor seamen
starving in the streets because there was no money to
pay their wages. 7 October, 1665: 'Did business, though
not much, at the Office; because of the horrible crowd and
lamentable moan of the poor seamen that lie starving in
the streets for lack of money, which do trouble and perplex
me to the heart; and more at noon when we were to
go through them, for then a whole hundred of them followed
us; some cursing, some swearing, and some praying to us.'<a name="Anchor-151" id="Anchor-151"></a><a href="#Footnote-151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 151.">[151]</a>
We hear of wages nine months<a name="Anchor-152" id="Anchor-152"></a><a href="#Footnote-152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 152.">[152]</a>, twenty-two<a name="Anchor-153" id="Anchor-153"></a><a href="#Footnote-153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 153.">[153]</a>, twenty-six,
thirty-four<a name="Anchor-154" id="Anchor-154"></a><a href="#Footnote-154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 154.">[154]</a>, and even fifty-two<a name="Anchor-155" id="Anchor-155"></a><a href="#Footnote-155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 155.">[155]</a> months in arrear. One
captain with a breezy style complains that for want of
pay 'instead of a young commander, he is rendered an old
beggar.'<a name="Anchor-156" id="Anchor-156"></a><a href="#Footnote-156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 156.">[156]</a> The crews of two ships petition the Navy Board
to order them their pay 'that their families may not be
altogether starved in the streets, and themselves go like
heathens, having nothing to cover their nakedness.'<a name="Anchor-157" id="Anchor-157"></a><a href="#Footnote-157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 157.">[157]</a> The
Commissioner at Portsmouth writes of workmen in the yard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>there, that they are turned out of doors by their landlords,
and perish more like dogs than men<a name="Anchor-158" id="Anchor-158"></a><a href="#Footnote-158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 158.">[158]</a>.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, this state of things affected discipline.
The crews of the <i>Little Victory</i> and the <i>Pearl</i> at Hull
mutinied for want of pay, and refused to weigh anchor<a name="Anchor-159" id="Anchor-159"></a><a href="#Footnote-159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 159.">[159]</a>, and
in the yards the workmen gave a great deal of trouble. The
Chatham shipwrights and caulkers, to whom two years'
wages were owing, marched up to London to appeal to the
Navy Board, as 'their families are denied trust and cannot
subsist,' and under this pressure we are told that arrangements
were made 'to pay off some of the most disorderly.'<a name="Anchor-160" id="Anchor-160"></a><a href="#Footnote-160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 160.">[160]</a>
At Chatham the Commissioner writes that he is almost
torn to pieces by the workmen of the yard for their weekly
pay<a name="Anchor-161" id="Anchor-161"></a><a href="#Footnote-161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 161.">[161]</a>. Sir John Mennes writes from Portsmouth on 14 July,
1665, for money to be sent immediately to stop 'the bawlings
and impatience of these people, especially of their wives,
whose tongues are as foul as the daughters of Billingsgate.'<a name="Anchor-162" id="Anchor-162"></a><a href="#Footnote-162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 162.">[162]</a>
Apparently the money did not come, and in October the
Commissioner was forced to lend the men ten shillings
apiece to keep them from mutiny<a name="Anchor-163" id="Anchor-163"></a><a href="#Footnote-163" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 163.">[163]</a>. A fortnight later a
mutiny actually broke out, but Commissioner Middleton
shewed praiseworthy promptitude in dealing with it. According
to his own account, he seized 'a good cudgel' out
of the hands of one of the men, and took more pains in the
use of it than in any business for the last twelve months.
He adds: 'I have not been troubled since.'<a name="Anchor-164" id="Anchor-164"></a><a href="#Footnote-164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 164.">[164]</a> On 27 October,
1666, the outlook in London was so threatening that the
Navy Board applied to the Officers of the Ordnance for
'twelve well-fixed firelocks with a supply of powder and
bullet' for the defence of the Navy Office, in view of 'the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>present great refractoriness and tumultuousness of the seamen.'<a name="Anchor-165" id="Anchor-165"></a><a href="#Footnote-165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 165.">[165]</a>
Nor did the trouble end when peace came, for the
financial situation was still difficult. On 11 March, 1671,
Jonas Shish wrote from Deptford to the Navy Board: 'The
shipwrights and caulkers are very much enraged by reason
that their wages is not paid them. The last night the whole
street next the King's Yard, both of men and women, was
in an uproar, and meeting with Mr Bagwell, my foreman,
they fell on him, and it was God's great mercy they
had not spoiled him. I was then without the gate at my
son's house, and hearing the tumult, I did think how Israel
stoned Hadoram that was over the tribute, and King Rehoboam
made speed and gat him up to fly to Jerusalem, so I
gat speedily into the King's Yard, for I judge if the rude
multitude had met with me, I should have had worse measure
than my foreman.'<a name="Anchor-166" id="Anchor-166"></a><a href="#Footnote-166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 166.">[166]</a></p>

<p>In view of these facts about pay, it is not surprising that
it was found difficult to obtain men. In order to man the
fleets for service against the Dutch it was necessary to
employ the press, and this produced very poor material.
Pepys notes in 1666 that men were pressed in London that
'were not liable to it,' 'poor patient labouring men and
housekeepers,'<a name="Anchor-167" id="Anchor-167"></a><a href="#Footnote-167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 167.">[167]</a> and he adds 'it is a great tyranny.' The
redoubtable Commissioner Middleton, writing from Portsmouth
on 29 March, 1666, tells Pepys that he is ashamed
to see such pressed men as are sent from Devonshire—one
with the falling sickness and a lame arm; another with dead
palsy on one side and not any use of his right arm<a name="Anchor-168" id="Anchor-168"></a><a href="#Footnote-168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 168.">[168]</a>. A year
later he makes similar complaints from Chatham with regard
to the pressed men supplied by Watermen's Hall. 'The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>Masters of Watermen's Hall are good Christians but very
knaves; they should be ordered to send down ten or twelve
old women to be nurses to the children they send.'<a name="Anchor-169" id="Anchor-169"></a><a href="#Footnote-169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 169.">[169]</a></p>

<p>On the outbreak of the Third Dutch War in 1672 the
same difficulties recurred, but the complaints are less frequent
and less serious, and the condition of things had
evidently improved. But ships had still to be manned by
pressing, and the quality of the pressed men left much to be
desired. For instance, two watermen, pressed in 1673, are
described as 'little children, and never at sea before,' who
could not be suffered 'to pester the ship.'<a name="Anchor-170" id="Anchor-170"></a><a href="#Footnote-170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 170.">[170]</a></p>

<p>'It can never be well in the navy,' wrote Pepys on 5 September,
1680, 'till the poor seamen can be paid once in a
year at furthest, and tickets answered like bills of exchange;
whereas at this very day ... ships are kept out two or three
years, and four of them just now ordered forth again only
for want of money, after being brought in to be paid off.'<a name="Anchor-171" id="Anchor-171"></a><a href="#Footnote-171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 171.">[171]</a>
A little later he notes the effect of this upon discipline<a name="Anchor-172" id="Anchor-172"></a><a href="#Footnote-172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 172.">[172]</a>, and
comments on the 'unreasonable hardship' entailed by 'the
general practice of our navy' 'of paying those ships off first
where the least sum clears the most men; those who have
served longest, and therefore need their pay most, being
postponed to those who have served least.'<a name="Anchor-173" id="Anchor-173"></a><a href="#Footnote-173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 173.">[173]</a> In a maturer
reflection made after his retirement, dated December, 1692,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Pepys still places the 'length and badness of the payment
of the seaman's wages' first among his 'discouragements.'
This, together with 'their ill-usage from commanders, and
want of permission to help themselves in intervals of public
service by a temporary liberty of earning a penny in the
merchant's' are 'discouragements that I cannot think anything
can be proposed of temptations of other kinds sufficient
to reconcile them to.'<a name="Anchor-174" id="Anchor-174"></a><a href="#Footnote-174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 174.">[174]</a> Nevertheless, Pepys claimed credit
for more punctual payments for the Special Commission of
1686, during the time they held office. 'Not a penny left unpaid,'
he writes, 'to any officer, seaman, workman, artificer,
or merchant, for any service done in, or commodity delivered
to the use of the Navy, either at sea or on shore, within the
whole time of this Commission, where the party claiming
the same was in the way to receive it.'<a name="Anchor-175" id="Anchor-175"></a><a href="#Footnote-175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 175.">[175]</a></p>

<p>In connexion with the seamen something should be said
about the organisation for the care of the sick and wounded.
The credit of being the first English Government to recognise
the obligation of providing for the sick and wounded
belongs to the Commonwealth. The principle that the State
should provide for those who had suffered in its service was
laid down by the Long Parliament in 1642, and an attempt
was made to apply it to the case of soldiers wounded in the
Civil War<a name="Anchor-176" id="Anchor-176"></a><a href="#Footnote-176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 176.">[176]</a>. A little later the same principle was applied to
seamen, and the idea and the machinery were taken over by
the Restoration statesmen. In October, 1664, in view of the
impending war with the Dutch, a temporary Commission
for the care of Sick and Wounded Seamen on the model of
the Commission of 1653 was appointed for the duration of
the war, the most active member of it being John Evelyn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>the diarist<a name="Anchor-177" id="Anchor-177"></a><a href="#Footnote-177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 177.">[177]</a>. This Commission was re-appointed in March,
1672, for the Third Dutch War, and the elaborate instructions
given to it are to be found in the volume of <cite>Naval
Precedents</cite> in the Pepysian Library<a name="Anchor-178" id="Anchor-178"></a><a href="#Footnote-178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 178.">[178]</a>. The Commissioners
were to distribute the sick and wounded among the hospitals
of England, 'thereby to ease his Majesty's charge'; and as
soon as this accommodation was exhausted, they were to
billet them upon private persons at the King's expense.
London, Yarmouth, Ipswich, Southwold, Aldeburgh, Harwich,
Chatham, Gravesend, Deal, Dover, Gosport, Southampton,
Weymouth, Dartmouth, and Plymouth were specially
assigned for the reception of sick and wounded men set
ashore from their ships. At these 'places of reception' as
they were called, the Commissioners were to appoint an
agent, and to provide 'a physician (if need be) and chirurgeon,
and nurses, fire, candle, linen, medicaments, and all
things necessary,' but in 'as husbandly and thrifty a manner'
as might be. The Commission was also charged with the
care of prisoners of war, and was instructed to provide for
their maintenance on a scale 'not exceeding 5<i>d.</i> per diem
for every common seaman and inferior officer, and 12<i>d.</i>
per diem for every commission officer.' For a time also it
was concerned with awarding gratuities to the 'widows,
children, and impotent parents of such as shall be slain in
his Majesty's service at sea'; but in 1673 these duties were
taken over by another commission, for Widows and Orphans,
and a regular scale was established on which gratuities were
to be given. Widows of men slain in the service were to
receive a gratuity equal to eleven months of their husband's
pay, an additional third being allowed to each orphan except
those who were married at the time of the father's death.
If the deceased left no widow, his mother was to receive the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>bounty, provided that she was herself a widow, indigent, and
over 50 years of age. The bounty to a child was to be allowed
to accumulate until it was of an age to be apprenticed. This
Commission terminated at the end of the war, and by an
order of 21 December, 1674, its functions devolved on the
Navy Board.</p>

<p>These arrangements were all admirable upon paper, and
the members of the Commissions displayed indefatigable industry,
but in this department of affairs as in others the best
of schemes were wrecked on the rock of finance. On 30 September,
1665, Evelyn wrote that he had 5000 sick, wounded,
and prisoners dying for want of bread and shelter. 'His
Majesty's subjects,' he adds, 'die in our sight and at our
thresholds without our being able to relieve them, which,
with our barbarous exposure of the prisoners to the utmost
of sufferings, must needs redound to his Majesty's great dishonour,
and to the consequence of losing the hearts of our
own people, who are ready to execrate and stone us as we
pass.'<a name="Anchor-179" id="Anchor-179"></a><a href="#Footnote-179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 179.">[179]</a> On 5 June, 1672, the same loyal and humane gentleman
wrote in a similar strain from Rochester: 'I have near
600 sick and wounded men in this place, 200 prisoners, and
the apprehension of hundreds more.... I hope there will be
care to supply my district here with moneys, or else I shall
be very miserable, for no poor creature does earn his bread
with greater anxiety than I at present.'<a name="Anchor-180" id="Anchor-180"></a><a href="#Footnote-180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 180.">[180]</a> The moneys did
not come, and by the end of the summer some of the localities
were becoming restive at the non-payment of arrears.
There was a great deal of noise made at Gravesend when
the Commissioners of the Navy passed by, and on 27 August
Evelyn wrote to Pepys: 'Those cursed people of Gravesend
have no bowels, and swear that they will receive not a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>more till their arrears are discharged. We are above £2000
indebted in Kent, where our daily charge is £100 for
quarters only. Judge by this how comfortable a station I
am in.'<a name="Anchor-181" id="Anchor-181"></a><a href="#Footnote-181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 181.">[181]</a></p>

<p>When the war came to an end the temporary Commission
was withdrawn, and by a warrant from the Lords of the
Admiralty dated 28 March, 1674, its duties were handed
over to James Pearse, 'chirurgeon-general of his Majesty's
navy.'<a name="Anchor-182" id="Anchor-182"></a><a href="#Footnote-182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 182.">[182]</a> Pearse was a man of business after Pepys's own
heart, and he carefully systematised the whole of his functions,
reducing them 'into such a method that it is not
possible for me (or whomsoever shall succeed me) to wrong
his Majesty or injure his subjects.'<a name="Anchor-183" id="Anchor-183"></a><a href="#Footnote-183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 183.">[183]</a></p>

<p>'Mariners and soldiers maimed in his Majesty's service at
sea' were entitled to relief out of the Chest at Chatham, a
fund provided by deducting 6<i>d.</i> a month from each man's pay.
Fourpence a month was also deducted for the maintenance
of a chaplain, and Pepys explains how the Chest benefited
from an arrangement by which all moneys were also assigned
to it 'arising out of the seamen's contributions for a chaplain
upon ships where (by the remissness or impiety of the
commander) no chaplain is provided.'<a name="Anchor-184" id="Anchor-184"></a><a href="#Footnote-184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 184.">[184]</a> A paper of 24 July,
1685<a name="Anchor-185" id="Anchor-185"></a><a href="#Footnote-185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 185.">[185]</a>, gives the scale of this relief:</p>

the chirurgeons, and certified to deserve what in their opinions may be

frequently accompany the loss of a limb in other parts of the body, for
which they have a reward apart from their annual allowance, according
to the chirurgeon's discretion.</p></div>

<p>One more question remains for our consideration to-day—that
of the rates of pay in the navy during the period 1660-88.</p>

<p>As far as the rates themselves were concerned the story
is one of steady improvement. In 1653 the pay of a general
or admiral of the fleet had been £3 a day during his employment;
of a vice-admiral, £2; and of a rear-admiral, £1<a name="Anchor-186" id="Anchor-186"></a><a href="#Footnote-186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 186.">[186]</a>.
The scale adopted by Order in Council, 26 February, 1666<a name="Anchor-187" id="Anchor-187"></a><a href="#Footnote-187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 187.">[187]</a>,
raised the admiral's pay from £3 to £4; the vice-admiral's
from £2 to £2. 10<i>s.</i>; and the rear-admiral's from £1 to £2.
The vice-admiral of a squadron only was to get 30<i>s.</i> and the
rear-admiral of a squadron £1. The pay of the other officers
was not increased beyond the rates fixed in 1653<a name="Anchor-188" id="Anchor-188"></a><a href="#Footnote-188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 188.">[188]</a>. The able
seamen in 1660 received 24<i>s.</i> a month; the ordinary seamen,
19<i>s.</i>; the apprentices or 'gromets,' 14<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; and the 'boys,'
9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The wages of the carpenter, boatswain, and gunner
varied from £2 to £4 a month according to the rate of the
ship. Monthly wages in harbour, as distinguished from sea
wages, were on a lower scale<a name="Anchor-189" id="Anchor-189"></a><a href="#Footnote-189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 189.">[189]</a>. In 1686 a new establishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>of wages<a name="Anchor-190" id="Anchor-190"></a><a href="#Footnote-190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 190.">[190]</a> made a few minor changes, but the pay of the
seamen was not affected thereby.</p>

<p>The misfortune of the 'poor seaman' was not that his
rate of pay was insufficient, but that he could not get his
money, or if he got it at all it was in the depreciated paper
currency known as the 'ticket.' A ticket was a certificate
from the officers of his ship, issued to each seaman, specifying
the term and quality of his service. This, when
countersigned by the Navy Board, was the seaman's warrant
for demanding his wages from the Treasurer of the
Navy on shore. The original purpose of tickets was to save
the necessity of transporting large sums of money on board
ship, but the want of funds in the navy soon made it the
regular practice to treat tickets as inconvertible paper, and
to discharge all seamen with tickets instead of money—or
with money for part of their time and a ticket for the rest.
Theoretically, the ticket should have supplied the seaman
with credit almost up to the full amount of his wages, but
in practice the long waiting and uncertainty of payment
caused a great depreciation of tickets. We hear of women
brokers standing about the Navy Office, offering to help
seamen who might have tickets to ready money—but always
upon terms. They took them to Mrs Salesbury in Carpenter's
Yard, near Aldgate, who bought them for cash at a discount
of at least 5<i>s.</i> in the £, and sometimes more<a name="Anchor-191" id="Anchor-191"></a><a href="#Footnote-191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 191.">[191]</a>. This
caused great discontent among the seamen, who naturally
objected to being paid by the State in depreciated paper,
and on 13 February, 1667, Pepys records in the <cite>Diary</cite> that
'there was a very great disorder this day at the Ticket
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Office, to the beating and bruising of the face' of one Carcasse,
the clerk. The grievance attracted attention, and in
1667 the House of Commons enquired into 'the buying and
selling of tickets.'<a name="Anchor-192" id="Anchor-192"></a><a href="#Footnote-192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 192.">[192]</a> The 'infinite great disorder' of the Ticket
Office also attracted the notice of the Commissioners of
Public Accounts<a name="Anchor-193" id="Anchor-193"></a><a href="#Footnote-193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 193.">[193]</a>, but the reply of the Navy Board when
invited to justify the practice was conclusive. 'We conceive
the use of tickets to be by no other means removable than
by a supply of money in every place, at all times, in readiness
where and when ... any ... occasions of discharging seamen
shall arise.'<a name="Anchor-194" id="Anchor-194"></a><a href="#Footnote-194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 194.">[194]</a></p>

<p>Apart from the disastrous results of the practice of issuing
tickets without money to pay them, the actual machinery of
the system was better under Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> than it had hitherto
been. Printed tickets with counterfoils had been invented
under the Commonwealth, and were in use as early as August,
1654<a name="Anchor-195" id="Anchor-195"></a><a href="#Footnote-195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 195.">[195]</a>; but in 1667 elaborate instructions for the examining
and signing of tickets and comparing them with the counterfoils
were issued by the Navy Board to protect the Office
against fraud<a name="Anchor-196" id="Anchor-196"></a><a href="#Footnote-196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 196.">[196]</a>. John Hollond complains of the abuses to
which even a solvent ticket system gave rise. It enabled
'wrong parties' to secure the seaman's wages—these being
'such as have wrought upon the advantage of the men's
necessities'—'either pursers, clerks of the check, or creditors,
whether alehouse-keepers, or slopsellers, or else pretended
sweethearts.'<a name="Anchor-197" id="Anchor-197"></a><a href="#Footnote-197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 197.">[197]</a> He also notes the facilities which the system
afforded for the abuse of 'dead pays,' tickets being issued
for seamen who were dead or who never served, and men
suborned to personate them at the pay-table<a name="Anchor-198" id="Anchor-198"></a><a href="#Footnote-198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 198.">[198]</a>. This was
particularly easy in time of war, when the pressure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>business was too great to allow of the tickets being properly
examined.</p>

<p>A new and important principle in connexion with the pay
of naval officers was established in 1668. Deane had urged
in 1653 that seamen should be entered for continuous service
and kept on continuous pay like soldiers<a name="Anchor-199" id="Anchor-199"></a><a href="#Footnote-199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 199.">[199]</a>, but the practice
of the navy was quite different, both for officers and men.
Hitherto it had been usual to regard naval officers as appointed
for particular services, and possessing no claim upon
the Government when these services had been discharged.
The result of this was that, except in time of war, the field
of employment was far too small, and a number of good
officers were thrown upon their own resources. But at the
close of the Second Dutch War the Government formally
recognised for the first time the claims of officers to pay in
time of peace. The first step did not go far, but the principle
now accepted was destined to lead to the modern system of
continuous employment. By an Order in Council of 17 July,
1668<a name="Anchor-200" id="Anchor-200"></a><a href="#Footnote-200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 200.">[200]</a>, it was provided that, in consideration of 'the eminent
services performed in the late war against the Dutch by the
flag officers,' and the fact that 'during the time of peace
several of them are out of employment, and thereby disabled
to support themselves in a condition answerable to their
merits and those marks of honour his Majesty hath conferred
on them,' they should receive 'pensions' in proportion to the
scale of pay on active service which had been fixed at the
beginning of the war. These 'pensions' ranged from £150
a year for captains of flag-ships up to £250 a year for rear-admirals
and vice-admirals of fleets<a name="Anchor-201" id="Anchor-201"></a><a href="#Footnote-201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 201.">[201]</a>. By an Order of 26 June,
1674, the same scale was established for flag officers who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>had served in the Third Dutch War<a name="Anchor-202" id="Anchor-202"></a><a href="#Footnote-202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 202.">[202]</a>; and in 1674 and 1675
the system of half-pay for officers when they were not being
actually employed was further extended to the captains and
masters of first and second rate ships who had served in the
war<a name="Anchor-203" id="Anchor-203"></a><a href="#Footnote-203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 203.">[203]</a>, and to the commanders of squadrons<a name="Anchor-204" id="Anchor-204"></a><a href="#Footnote-204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 204.">[204]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1672<a name="Anchor-205" id="Anchor-205"></a><a href="#Footnote-205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 205.">[205]</a> another important change relating to pay was
made by the Council. The principle of pensions on superannuation
was adopted for officers. These were to be 'equal
to the salary and known allowances they enjoyed,' provided
that they had completed fifteen years of service 'where the
employment is constant, such as that of boatswains, gunners,
pursers, carpenters, &amp;c.,' or eight years where it is not constant,
'such as that of masters, chirurgeons, &amp;c.' In 1673<a name="Anchor-206" id="Anchor-206"></a><a href="#Footnote-206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 206.">[206]</a>
the principle of superannuation was extended from cases of
old age to officers wounded in service at sea. Such officers
were to receive one year's wages, 'and the continuance of
them in pay during the whole time they shall by good proof
appear to have lain under cure.'</p>

<small>VICTUALLING; DISCIPLINE; SHIPS; GUNS</small></h2>


<p>The arrangements for victualling had always had an important
bearing upon the contentment and efficiency of the
seamen. 'However the pay of the mariners, both for sea and
harbour, may be wanting for some time,' wrote one of the
Victuallers, 'yet they must have continual supplies of victuals,
otherwise they will be apt to fall into very great
disorders.'<a name="Anchor-207" id="Anchor-207"></a><a href="#Footnote-207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 207.">[207]</a> Pepys, in his private <cite>Minute Book</cite><a name="Anchor-208" id="Anchor-208"></a><a href="#Footnote-208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 208.">[208]</a>, makes the
same point. 'Englishmen,' he says, 'and more especially
seamen, love their bellies above anything else, and therefore
it must always be remembered, in the management of the
victualling of the navy, that to make any abatement from
them in the quantity or agreeableness of the victuals, is to
discourage and provoke them in the tenderest point, and
will sooner render them disgusted with the King's service
than any one other hardship that can be put upon them.'
But in this department also the want of money had fatal
effects, and contributed more than any other cause to the
comparative failure of the administration to provide victuals
of good quality, sufficient quantity, and promptly delivered
where they were required.</p>

<p>Before the Restoration the victualling was being managed
by Victualling Commissioners 'upon account,' the State
keeping the business in its own hands<a name="Anchor-209" id="Anchor-209"></a><a href="#Footnote-209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 209.">[209]</a>. But the system had
scarcely a fair trial owing to financial embarrassments<a name="Anchor-210" id="Anchor-210"></a><a href="#Footnote-210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 210.">[210]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>and just before the King's return matters were as bad as
they could well be<a name="Anchor-211" id="Anchor-211"></a><a href="#Footnote-211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 211.">[211]</a>. The restored Government reverted to
the older system of contract, and in September, 1660, Denis
Gauden was appointed contractor under the satisfying title
of 'surveyor-general of all victuals to be provided for his
Majesty's ships and maritime causes,' with a fee of £50 a
year, and 8<i>d.</i> a day for a clerk<a name="Anchor-212" id="Anchor-212"></a><a href="#Footnote-212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 212.">[212]</a>. The whole burden of the
victualling therefore rested upon a single man, and when
the war with the Dutch broke out, he was unable to grapple
with its demands; yet no fundamental change could be made
in the system until the Government was in a position to
settle accounts with him. Thus the victuals, although on the
whole good in quality, were deficient in quantity, and when
Gauden was remonstrated with he could always reply, and
generally with perfect truth, that it was impossible for him
to do better as long as the Government failed to carry out
their part of the contract, and to make payments on account
at the stipulated times<a name="Anchor-213" id="Anchor-213"></a><a href="#Footnote-213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 213.">[213]</a>. In the spring of 1665, when the
fleet was fitting for sea, complaints of the failure of the Victualler
were frequent<a name="Anchor-214" id="Anchor-214"></a><a href="#Footnote-214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 214.">[214]</a>. Later on, when Pepys went down to
visit the fleet in September, Lord Sandwich told him that
most of the ships had been without beer 'these three weeks
or month, and but few days' dry provisions.'<a name="Anchor-215" id="Anchor-215"></a><a href="#Footnote-215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 215.">[215]</a> In this year
complaints of uneatable provisions occur, though not often,
but when they were bad they were sometimes very bad. On
10 August, Commissioner Middleton wrote to Pepys from
Portsmouth that the <i>Coventry</i> was still in port; her beer
had nearly poisoned one man, who 'being thirsty drank a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>great draught.'<a name="Anchor-216" id="Anchor-216"></a><a href="#Footnote-216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 216.">[216]</a> Probably now, as undoubtedly later, the
backwardness of the victualling in turn reacted upon the
deficiency of men, for the sailors deserted from ships where
they could get no food<a name="Anchor-217" id="Anchor-217"></a><a href="#Footnote-217" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 217.">[217]</a>.</p>

<p>The practical breakdown of the victualling system during
the spring and summer of 1665 led to the establishment, at
Pepys's suggestion, of new machinery for keeping the Victualler
up to the mark—a Surveyor of Victuals appointed
at the King's charge in each port, with power to examine
the Victualler's books; and a central officer in London to
whom they were to report weekly<a name="Anchor-218" id="Anchor-218"></a><a href="#Footnote-218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 218.">[218]</a>. As soon as Pepys's plan
was adopted, he wrote to suggest that he himself should be
the new Surveyor-General of Victualling<a name="Anchor-219" id="Anchor-219"></a><a href="#Footnote-219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 219.">[219]</a>, and on 27 October
he accepted office<a name="Anchor-220" id="Anchor-220"></a><a href="#Footnote-220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 220.">[220]</a> at a salary of £300 a year<a name="Anchor-221" id="Anchor-221"></a><a href="#Footnote-221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 221.">[221]</a>. The appointment
was temporary only, and came to an end at the
conclusion of peace. While it lasted it effected a slight improvement.
Pepys himself was much pleased with the success
of his arrangements, and he was complimented upon
them by the Duke of York<a name="Anchor-222" id="Anchor-222"></a><a href="#Footnote-222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 222.">[222]</a>. As he had £500 a year from
Gauden as well as the £300 from the King<a name="Anchor-223" id="Anchor-223"></a><a href="#Footnote-223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 223.">[223]</a>, he managed to
do well out of the war.</p>

<p>The experience of the war had shewn the weak points of
the one-man system, and in subsequent contracts several
Victuallers were associated in a kind of partnership<a name="Anchor-224" id="Anchor-224"></a><a href="#Footnote-224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 224.">[224]</a>, but the
fundamental difficulty was one of finance, and this a mere
multiplication of persons did little to meet. Thus there
are complaints in 1671<a name="Anchor-225" id="Anchor-225"></a><a href="#Footnote-225" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 225.">[225]</a>, and the difficulties were greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>increased when the Third Dutch War broke out in the spring
of 1672. The Victuallers received such scanty payments from
the Government that they had to carry on the service with
their own money and credit<a name="Anchor-226" id="Anchor-226"></a><a href="#Footnote-226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 226.">[226]</a>, and eventually their condition
in respect of funds became 'so exceeding strait' that they
could not make proper deliveries<a name="Anchor-227" id="Anchor-227"></a><a href="#Footnote-227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 227.">[227]</a>. This provoked the commanders
at sea to take the field against them, and Prince
Rupert was so annoyed that he declared that he would never
thrive at sea till some were hanged on land<a name="Anchor-228" id="Anchor-228"></a><a href="#Footnote-228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 228.">[228]</a>; and a little
later expressed the opinion that the only way to deal with
the Victuallers would be to send one of them on shipboard,
there to stay in what condition his Majesty shall think fitting,
till they have thoroughly victualled the fleet<a name="Anchor-229" id="Anchor-229"></a><a href="#Footnote-229" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 229.">[229]</a>.</p>

<p>It is, on the whole, to the credit of the Victuallers that the
complaints as to quality are not more numerous than they
are during this period of large demands and scanty payment.
If you would care for illustrations, on 15 March, 1671,
on board the <i>Reserve</i> 'there was a general complaint amongst
the seamen, both of the badness of the meat and want of
weight.'<a name="Anchor-230" id="Anchor-230"></a><a href="#Footnote-230" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 230.">[230]</a> On 6 September, 1672, there was a protest from
the <i>Gloucester</i> against the badness of the beer; but the Victuallers
replied rather ambiguously that their beer was as
good as ever was used in the fleet, and they counted themselves
happy in that they had been afflicted with less bad
beer 'by many degrees than ever was in such an action.'<a name="Anchor-231" id="Anchor-231"></a><a href="#Footnote-231" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 231.">[231]</a>
On 29 September the commander of the <i>Augustine</i> wrote
to say that the doctor attributed the sickness among his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>men to the extreme badness of the beer<a name="Anchor-232" id="Anchor-232"></a><a href="#Footnote-232" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 232.">[232]</a>; while objection was
also taken to an untimely dispensation of rotten cheese<a name="Anchor-233" id="Anchor-233"></a><a href="#Footnote-233" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 233.">[233]</a>.</p>

<p>The victualling contract of which we possess the fullest
details was that of 31 December, 1677<a name="Anchor-234" id="Anchor-234"></a><a href="#Footnote-234" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 234.">[234]</a>. From this it appears
that the daily allowance of each man was 'one pound averdupois
of good, clean, sweet, sound, well-bolted with a horse-cloth,
well-baked, and well-conditioned wheaten biscuit; one
gallon, wine measure, of beer' ... 'two pounds averdupois of
beef, killed and made up with salt in England, of a well-fed
ox ... for Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays'—or,
instead of beef, for two of those days one pound averdupois
of bacon, or salted English pork, of a well-fed hog ... and a
pint of pease (Winchester measure) therewith' ...; 'and for
Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, every man, besides
the aforesaid allowance of bread and beer, to have by the
day the eighth part of a full-sized North Sea cod of 24 inches
long, or a sixth part of a haberdine 22 inches long, or a quarter
part of the same sort if but 16 inches long ... or a pound averdupois
of well-savoured Poor John, together with two ounces
of butter, and four ounces of Suffolk cheese, or two-thirds
of that weight of Cheshire.' The contract provides for English
beef because there was a strong prejudice in the navy
against Irish beef. Pepys quotes one writer as saying 'The
Irish meat is very unwholesome, as well as lean, and rots
our men'<a name="Anchor-235" id="Anchor-235"></a><a href="#Footnote-235" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 235.">[235]</a>; and John Hollond argues that to serve Irish beef
was greatly to discourage the seamen<a name="Anchor-236" id="Anchor-236"></a><a href="#Footnote-236" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 236.">[236]</a>. 'Haberdine' is salt
or sun-dried cod, and 'Poor John' is salted or dried hake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of vessels sailing 'to the southward of the
latitude of 39 degrees N.' it was allowable for the contractors
to vary the diet—'In lieu of a pound of biscuit, a pound of
rusk of equal fineness; in lieu of a gallon of beer, a wine
quart of beverage wine or half a wine pint of brandy ... in
lieu of a piece of beef or pork with pease, three pounds of
flour and a pound of raisins (not worse than Malaga), or in
lieu of raisins, half a pound of currants or half a pound of
beef suet pickled; in lieu of a sized fish, four pounds of Milan
rice or two stockfishes of at least 16 inches long; in lieu of
a pound of butter or two pounds of Suffolk cheese, a wine
pint of sweet olive oil.' The separate victualling contract for
the Mediterranean<a name="Anchor-237" id="Anchor-237"></a><a href="#Footnote-237" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 237.">[237]</a> provided for this lighter diet there in
any case; but the variation was not popular among the seamen.
In Captain Boteler's <cite>Six Dialogues about Sea Services</cite>,
printed in 1685 but written some fifty years earlier, the
'admiral,' who, having just been appointed to the 'high-admiralship,'
is occupied throughout the book in remedying
an abysmal ignorance of naval matters by conversation with
a 'sea-captain,' suggests that it would be better for the health
of the mariners if the ordinary victualling were assimilated
'to the manner of foreign parts.' 'Without doubt, my lord,'
replies the captain, 'our much, and indeed excessive feeding
upon these salt meats at sea cannot but procure much unhealthiness
and infection, and is questionless one main cause
that our English are so subject to calentures, scarbots, and
the like contagious diseases above all other nations; so that
it were to be wished that we did more conform ourselves, if
not to the Spanish and Italian nations, who live most upon
rice-meal, oatmeal, biscake, figs, olives, oil, and the like, yet
at the least to our neighbours the Dutch, who content themselves
with a far less proportion of flesh and fish than we do,
and instead thereof do make it up with pease, beans, wheat-flour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>butter, cheese, and those white meats (as they are
called).' To this view the admiral assents, but he adds, 'The
difficulty consisteth in that the common seamen with us are
so besotted on their beef and pork as they had rather adventure
on all the calentures and scarbots in the world than
to be weaned from their customary diet, or so much as to lose
the least bit of it.' I should explain that a calenture is a fever,
associated with delirium, to which sailors in the tropics were
peculiarly liable; and scarbot is the scurvy<a name="Anchor-238" id="Anchor-238"></a><a href="#Footnote-238" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 238.">[238]</a>.</p>

<p>Pepys expected much from the new contract of 1677<a name="Anchor-239" id="Anchor-239"></a><a href="#Footnote-239" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 239.">[239]</a>,
but the old complaints of delay and bad quality recur<a name="Anchor-240" id="Anchor-240"></a><a href="#Footnote-240" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 240.">[240]</a>, and
in 1683 his successors decided to abandon contract in favour
of a state victualling department resembling in its general
character the system of victualling 'upon account,'<a name="Anchor-241" id="Anchor-241"></a><a href="#Footnote-241" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 241.">[241]</a> established
from 1655 to the Restoration. If we may infer anything
from the silence of the <cite>Admiralty Letters</cite>, hitherto so
vocal upon the subject, this change of method resulted in an
improvement in the victualling of the navy, and on the whole
the Victualling Office did not come out badly under the test
of the mobilisation of 1688. The necessity for this had been
realised about the middle of August, and at first the delays
caused a good deal of anxiety; but by the end of October
Pepys was able to report that the fleet is 'now (God be
thanked) at the Gunfleet, and in very good condition there.'<a name="Anchor-242" id="Anchor-242"></a><a href="#Footnote-242" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 242.">[242]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>There were still ships waiting to be got ready for sea, but
of these he writes: 'I do with the same zeal continue to
press the despatch of the rest that are behind that I would
do for my victuals if I were hungry.'<a name="Anchor-243" id="Anchor-243"></a><a href="#Footnote-243" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 243.">[243]</a></p>


<p class="mt2">One of the earlier acts of the Restoration Government
was the passing of a statute to incorporate into the system
of English law the ordinances already in force during the
Interregnum for regulating the discipline of the navy. Before
1652 such crimes as murder and manslaughter on board
ship had been punishable by the ordinary law, and lesser
offences by the 'known orders and customs of the seas';<a name="Anchor-244" id="Anchor-244"></a><a href="#Footnote-244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 244.">[244]</a>
but in that year the service was for the first time subjected
to articles of war,<a name="Anchor-245" id="Anchor-245"></a><a href="#Footnote-245" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 245.">[245]</a> and it was upon these that the provisions
of the Act of 1661<a name="Anchor-246" id="Anchor-246"></a><a href="#Footnote-246" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 246.">[246]</a> were founded. By this commanders at
sea were empowered to try a great variety of offences by
court-martial, and for many of these the maximum penalty
was death. This Act continued to govern the navy until
the reign of George <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>.</p>

<p>Another Act, of 1664,<a name="Anchor-247" id="Anchor-247"></a><a href="#Footnote-247" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 247.">[247]</a> dealt with two matters which had
given a great deal of trouble to the Navy Board—the frequent
embezzlement of naval stores, and the riots among
disappointed seamen who could not get their pay. Efforts
had been already made to prevent embezzlement by adopting
special modes of manufacture for the King's rope, sails,
and pennants, and by marking other stores with the broad
arrow;<a name="Anchor-248" id="Anchor-248"></a><a href="#Footnote-248" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 248.">[248]</a> but there were some things, such as nails and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>other kinds of ironwork, which could not be thus marked.
Ironwork in particular was especially favoured by the depredators,
because it could be so easily disposed of. In August,
1663, an illicit storehouse discovered at Deptford for the
reception of nails, iron shot, and other embezzled ironwork,
was described as the 'gulf that swallows up all from any
place brought to him.'<a name="Anchor-249" id="Anchor-249"></a><a href="#Footnote-249" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 249.">[249]</a> The riots also had been a serious
matter. The preamble of the Act gives as the ground of
legislation 'diverse fightings, quarrellings, and disturbances
... in and about his Majesty's offices, yards, and stores,' and
'frequent differences and disorders' which had occurred on
pay-days through 'the unreasonable turbulency of seamen.'
To meet this state of things the Act invests the Navy Board
with some of the powers of magistrates, and authorises them
to punish riots and embezzlements with fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p>The Act was useful, but it did not entirely stop embezzlement.
In September, 1666, a prize worth £300 was plundered
of her lading, and 'will soon,' we are told, 'be dismantled of
all her rigging, till she will not have a rope's end left to hang
herself, or the thievish seamen that go in her.'<a name="Anchor-250" id="Anchor-250"></a><a href="#Footnote-250" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 250.">[250]</a> Chatham
Harbour had always been 'miserably infested' with 'thieves
and pilfering rogues,'<a name="Anchor-251" id="Anchor-251"></a><a href="#Footnote-251" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 251.">[251]</a> and in February, 1668, the clerk of
the check wrote, 'our people's hands are of late so inured to
stealing, that if the sawyers leave any work in the pits half
cut, it's a hazard whether they find it in the morning.'<a name="Anchor-252" id="Anchor-252"></a><a href="#Footnote-252" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 252.">[252]</a> The
state of things complained of was partly due to the uncertainty
of pay. As far as the riots of seamen were concerned,
the Act was a failure, as for their grievances force was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>remedy. Pepys writes on 4 November, 1665<a name="Anchor-253" id="Anchor-253"></a><a href="#Footnote-253" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 253.">[253]</a>, when the Act
of 1664 was in full operation, 'After dinner I to the Office
and there late, and much troubled to have a hundred seamen
all the afternoon there, swearing below and cursing us, and
breaking the glass windows, and swear they will pull the
house down on Tuesday next. I sent word of this to Court,
but nothing will help it but money and a rope.'</p>

<p>The period of Pepys's first Secretaryship witnessed several
attempts to effect an improvement in naval discipline. Abuses
connected with the unlimited number of cabins built on the
King's ships, leading to 'the pestering of the ship,' 'contracting
of sickness,' temptation to officers 'to neglect their duties and
mis-spend their time in drinking and debauchery,' and 'the
danger of fire,' led to the adoption, on 16 October, 1673, of
a regular establishment of cabins for ships of each rate<a name="Anchor-254" id="Anchor-254"></a><a href="#Footnote-254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 254.">[254]</a>.</p>

<p>Another abuse of long standing had been the taking of
merchants' goods in the King's ships. Sir Robert Slyngesbie
had observed in his <cite>Discourse</cite><a name="Anchor-255" id="Anchor-255"></a><a href="#Footnote-255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 255.">[255]</a> in 1660 that this made it easy
for the officers to sell the King's stores under the pretence
that they were merchandise; to waste time in the ports
which ought to have been spent at sea; and so to fill the
ship's hold 'that they have no room to throw by their chests
and other cumbersome things upon occasion of fight, whereby
the gun decks are so encumbered that they cannot possibly
make so good an opposition to an enemy as otherwise they
might'; and, lastly, to defraud the custom-house. In 1674
Pepys took the matter up, and induced the King to take
severe notice of the offenders<a name="Anchor-256" id="Anchor-256"></a><a href="#Footnote-256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 256.">[256]</a>, and in one particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>flagrant case of 1675 to offer the delinquent commander the
alternative of imprisonment until trial by court-martial, or
forfeiting the whole of his pay for the voyage, and 'making
good to the poor of the Chest' at Chatham out of his own
purse the value of the freight of the merchants' goods brought
home by him<a name="Anchor-257" id="Anchor-257"></a><a href="#Footnote-257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 257.">[257]</a>.</p>

<p>The absence of commanders from their ships without leave
gave a good deal of trouble during the period 1673-9. On
1 October, 1673, the Commissioners of the Admiralty ordered
that the commanders should be 'pricked out of pay' for such
absences<a name="Anchor-258" id="Anchor-258"></a><a href="#Footnote-258" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 258.">[258]</a>; but on 25 May, 1675, Pepys observes 'with much
trouble' that the 'late resolutions' 'are already forgotten,'
commanders 'appearing daily in the town' without leave<a name="Anchor-259" id="Anchor-259"></a><a href="#Footnote-259" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 259.">[259]</a>.
On 9 July he 'spied' the captain of the <i>Lark</i> 'at a distance
sauntering up and down Covent Garden, as I have too often
heretofore observed him spending his time when the King's
service required his attendance on shipboard, as it doth at
this day—a practice which shall never pass my knowledge
in any commander (be he who he will) without my taking
notice of it to his Majesty and my Lords of the Admiralty.'<a name="Anchor-260" id="Anchor-260"></a><a href="#Footnote-260" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 260.">[260]</a>
Three years later complaints of this kind became very frequent,
and so to the end of Pepys's first Secretaryship in
1679. On 24 March, 1678, he writes: 'I must confess I have
never observed so frequent and scandalous instances as I do
at this day by commanders hovering daily about the Court
and town, though without the least pretence for it.'<a name="Anchor-261" id="Anchor-261"></a><a href="#Footnote-261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 261.">[261]</a> 'I would
to God,' he writes on 29 June to Sir Thomas Allin, 'you
could offer me something that may be an effectual cure to
the liberty taken by commanders of leaving their ships upon
pretence of private occasions, and staying long in town, to
the great dishonour of his Majesty's service, and corrupting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>the discipline of the Navy by their example ... it seeming
impossible as well as unreasonable to keep the door constantly
barred against commanders' desires of coming to
town upon just and pressing occasions of their families, and
of the other hand no less hard upon the King that his gracious
nature as well as his service should be always liable to
be imposed upon by commanders, as often as their humours,
pleasures, or (it may be) vices shall incline them to come
ashore. Pray think of it and help me herein, for, as I shall
never be guilty of withstanding any gentleman's just occasions
and desires in this matter, so I shall never be able to
sit still and silent under the scandalous liberties that I see
every day taken by commanders of playing with his Majesty's
service, as if it were an indifferent matter whether
they give any attendance on board their ships, so as they
have their wages as if they did.'<a name="Anchor-262" id="Anchor-262"></a><a href="#Footnote-262" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 262.">[262]</a></p>

<p>The official correspondence of 1673-9, although it reveals
a grievous laxity of discipline<a name="Anchor-263" id="Anchor-263"></a><a href="#Footnote-263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 263.">[263]</a>, exhibits Pepys himself in a
favourable light. He had a high sense of the honour of the
service, and shewed himself both firm and humane in his
dealings with his official inferiors. He was at great pains to
keep himself informed of the proceedings of the commanders,
and when breaches of discipline were reported to him, he
took infinite trouble to arrive at the facts. His admonitions
to the offenders, though sometimes a little unctuous, are as
a rule in the best Pepysian style.</p>

<p>The decay of discipline in the Restoration period has
been associated by some writers with the practice of appointing
'gentlemen captains' without experience to important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>commands at sea. The matter is discussed by Macaulay,
picturesquely but with exaggeration<a name="Anchor-264" id="Anchor-264"></a><a href="#Footnote-264" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 264.">[264]</a>; Pepys, in the <cite>Diary</cite>,
quotes Coventry as referring to the 'unruliness' of the
'young gentlemen captains'<a name="Anchor-265" id="Anchor-265"></a><a href="#Footnote-265" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 265.">[265]</a> and confessing 'that the more
of the cavaliers are put in, the less of discipline hath followed
in the fleet'<a name="Anchor-266" id="Anchor-266"></a><a href="#Footnote-266" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 266.">[266]</a>; and a Restoration paper printed in Charnock's
<cite>Marine Architecture</cite><a name="Anchor-267" id="Anchor-267"></a><a href="#Footnote-267" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 267.">[267]</a> very much shocks that author by its
'illiberal and improper observations' on the subject. He
admits, however, that 'there certainly appears much truth
and solidity in the general principle of them,' though 'it
might have been wished for the sake of decency and propriety'
that the writer 'had conveyed his animadversions in
somewhat less vulgar terms.' The victim of Charnock's
criticism traces every kind of evil to the year 1660, when
'gentlemen came to command in the navy.' These 'have
had the honour to bring drinking, gaming, whoring, swearing,
and all impiety into the navy, and banish all order and
sobriety out of their ships'; they have cast their ships away
for want of seamanship<a name="Anchor-268" id="Anchor-268"></a><a href="#Footnote-268" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 268.">[268]</a>; they have habitually delayed in
port when they should have been at sea; a gentleman captain
will bring 'near twenty landmen into the ship as his footmen,
tailor, barber, fiddlers, decayed kindred, volunteer gentlemen
or acquaintance, as companions,' and these 'are of
Bishop Williams's opinion, that Providence made man to
live ashore, and it is necessity that drives him to sea.' The
writer concludes that 'the Crown will at all times be better
able to secure trade, prevent the growth of the naval strength
of our enemy, with £100,000 under a natural sea admiralty
and seamen captains ... than with three times that sum under
land admirals and gentlemen captains not bred tarpaulins.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>With some qualifications this is the view of Pepys. He disclaims
hostility to gentlemen captains as such; but he quotes
from a speech delivered by Colonel Birch in the House of
Commons, in which he had urged that one of the 'present
miscarriages' of the navy is that 'employment and favour
are now bestowed wholly upon gentlemen, to the great discouragement
of tarpaulins of Wapping and Blackwall, from
whence ... the good commanders of old were all used to be
chosen.'<a name="Anchor-269" id="Anchor-269"></a><a href="#Footnote-269" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 269.">[269]</a> Pepys also refers to the liberty taken by gentlemen
commanders of 'thinking themselves above the necessity of
obeying orders, and conforming themselves to the rules and
discipline of the Navy, in reliance upon the protection secured
to them therein through the quality of their friends at Court.'<a name="Anchor-270" id="Anchor-270"></a><a href="#Footnote-270" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 270.">[270]</a>
Pepys himself was probably an impartial witness, for he was
denounced by each side for favouring the other<a name="Anchor-271" id="Anchor-271"></a><a href="#Footnote-271" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 271.">[271]</a>.</p>

<p>It is in a way remarkable that during the period of complaints
against gentlemen captains we come upon the first
establishment of an examination for lieutenants. Towards
the end of 1677 complaints reached the Admiralty from
Sir John Narbrough, commanding in the Mediterranean, of
the 'defectiveness' of his lieutenants 'in their seamanship.'<a name="Anchor-272" id="Anchor-272"></a><a href="#Footnote-272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 272.">[272]</a>
Pepys also refers to 'the general ignorance and dulness of
our lieutenants of ships' as 'a great evil' of which 'all sober
commanders at this day' complain. They are 'for the most
part (at least those of later standing) made out of volunteers,
who having passed some time superficially at sea, and being
related to families of interest at Court, do obtain lieutenancies
before they are fitted for it.'<a name="Anchor-273" id="Anchor-273"></a><a href="#Footnote-273" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 273.">[273]</a> The result was the adoption
on 18 December of a regular establishment<a name="Anchor-274" id="Anchor-274"></a><a href="#Footnote-274" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 274.">[274]</a>, drawn up by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Pepys<a name="Anchor-275" id="Anchor-275"></a><a href="#Footnote-275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 275.">[275]</a>, 'for ascertaining the duty of a sea-lieutenant, and for
examining persons pretending to that office.' A lieutenant
was required to have served three years actually at sea; to
be 20 years of age at least; to produce 'good certificates'
from the commanders under whom he had served of his
'sobriety, diligence, obedience to order,' and 'application to
the study and practice of the art of navigation,' as well as
three further certificates—from a member of the Navy Board
who had served as a commander, from a flag officer, and from
a commander of a first or second rate—'upon a solemn examination,'
held at the Navy Office, of 'his ability to judge
of and perform the duty of an able seaman and midshipman,
and his having attained to a sufficient degree of knowledge
in the theory of navigation capacitating him thereto.' Candidates
were sometimes ploughed<a name="Anchor-276" id="Anchor-276"></a><a href="#Footnote-276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 276.">[276]</a>, and this, as Pepys points
out, was an encouragement to the 'true-bred seaman' and
greatly to the benefit of the King's service. 'I thank
God,' he writes in 1678<a name="Anchor-277" id="Anchor-277"></a><a href="#Footnote-277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 277.">[277]</a>, 'we have not half the throng of
those of the bastard breed pressing for employments which
we heretofore used to be troubled with, they being conscious
of their inability to pass this examination, and know it to
be to no purpose now to solicit for employments till they
have done it.'</p>

<p>To about the same time as the examination for lieutenants
belongs another minor reform—an establishment for the
better provision of naval chaplains. In April or May, 1677,
the King and Lords of the Admiralty resolved 'that no persons
shall be entertained as chaplains on board his Majesty's
ships but such as shall be approved of by the Lord Bishop
of London.'<a name="Anchor-278" id="Anchor-278"></a><a href="#Footnote-278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 278.">[278]</a> The proposal originated in the first instance
with Pepys, who designed it to remedy 'the ill-effects of the
looseness wherein that matter lay, with respect both to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>honour of God Almighty and the preservation of sobriety
and good discipline in his Majesty's fleet.'<a name="Anchor-279" id="Anchor-279"></a><a href="#Footnote-279" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 279.">[279]</a> The details of
the scheme were more fully worked out by resolutions
adopted by the Admiralty Commission on 15 December,
1677<a name="Anchor-280" id="Anchor-280"></a><a href="#Footnote-280" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 280.">[280]</a>.</p>

<p>An important measure which had an indirect bearing upon
discipline was James <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>'s 'establishment about plate carriage
and allowance for captains' tables,'<a name="Anchor-281" id="Anchor-281"></a><a href="#Footnote-281" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 281.">[281]</a> dated 15 July, 1686. The
title of the establishment gives little indication of its real
scope; it was designed to give the Admiralty a better control
over ships on foreign service, and at the same time so to
improve the position of the commanders as to put them
beyond the reach of temptations to neglect their public duty
for private gain. The preamble refers to the 'general disorder'
into which the discipline of the navy has 'of late
years' fallen, and especially to the particular evil arising
from 'the liberty taken by commanders of our ships (upon
all opportunities of private profit) of converting the service
of our said ships to their own use, and the total neglect of
the public ends for which they, at our great charge, are set
forth and maintained, namely, the annoying of our enemies,
the protecting the estates of our trading subjects, and the
support of our honour with foreign princes.' Commanders
are accordingly forbidden to convey money, jewels, merchandise,
or passengers without the King's warrant; and
copies of orders given by admirals or commanders-in-chief
are to be sent to the Secretary of the Admiralty, as also
interim reports of proceedings, and a complete journal at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>the end of the voyage. In consideration of these requirements,
commanders are to receive substantial additional
allowances 'for the support of their tables,' ranging from
£83 a year to £250 according to the ship's rate.</p>

<p>The reign of James <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> was in a peculiar degree a period
of the framing and revising of 'establishments,' and on
13 April, 1686, a new establishment was made concerning
'volunteers and midshipmen extraordinary.'<a name="Anchor-282" id="Anchor-282"></a><a href="#Footnote-282" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 282.">[282]</a> This appears
to be a confirmation of an earlier establishment of 4 May,
1676, designed to afford encouragement 'to families of better
quality ... to breed up their younger sons to the art and practice
of navigation' by 'the bearing several young gentlemen,
to the ends aforesaid' on board the King's ships as 'volunteers,'
and to provide employment for ex-commanders or
lieutenants by carrying them as 'midshipmen extraordinary'
over and above the ordinary complement assigned to the
ship in which they sailed. Another 'establishment' of the
same period is that of November, 1686, for boatswains' and
carpenters' sea stores<a name="Anchor-283" id="Anchor-283"></a><a href="#Footnote-283" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 283.">[283]</a>.</p>

<p>During the earlier part of Pepys's second Secretaryship,
drunkenness gave a good deal of trouble. For instance, in
1685 the commander of the <i>Diamond</i> complained that his
officers were 'sottish, and unfit to serve the King,' particularly
the gunner, who was 'dead drunk in his cabin when the
powder was to be taken out.'<a name="Anchor-284" id="Anchor-284"></a><a href="#Footnote-284" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 284.">[284]</a> Pepys refers on 5 August,
1684, to 'the generality of that vice, now running through the
whole navy,'<a name="Anchor-285" id="Anchor-285"></a><a href="#Footnote-285" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 285.">[285]</a> and on 4 February, 1685, he writes, 'Till that
vice be cured, which I find too far spread in the navy, both
by sea and land, I do despair of ever seeing his Majesty's
service therein to thrive, and as I have given one or two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>instances of my care therein already, so shall I not fail by the
grace of God to persevere in it, as far as I am able, till it be
thoroughly cured, let it light where it will.'<a name="Anchor-286" id="Anchor-286"></a><a href="#Footnote-286" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 286.">[286]</a> In these efforts
the Secretary of the Admiralty, was soon to be powerfully
supported by the new King, 'there being no one vice,'
Pepys writes on 15 February, 1685, 'which can give more
just occasion of offence to his Majesty than that of drunkenness,
for the restraining which, as well in the navy as in
every other part of the service, I well know he has immoveably
determined to have the severest means used, nor shall
I in my station fail (according to his commands and my
duty) to give my helping hand thereto.'<a name="Anchor-287" id="Anchor-287"></a><a href="#Footnote-287" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 287.">[287]</a></p>

<p>In connexion with discipline it may be mentioned that
even as early as the Restoration there were labour troubles
in the dockyards. In 1663 a separate room was applied for in
the new storehouse at Portsmouth for use as a workroom,
'as seamen and carpenters will never agree to work together.'<a name="Anchor-288" id="Anchor-288"></a><a href="#Footnote-288" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 288.">[288]</a>
In the same year the clerk of the Portsmouth ropeyard complained
of the workmen employed there. By hasty spinning
they finished what they called a day's work by dinner-time,
and then refused to work again till four o'clock. 'Yesterday,'
he writes, 'about twenty-five of them left the work to go to
the alehouse, where, I think, they remain.'<a name="Anchor-289" id="Anchor-289"></a><a href="#Footnote-289" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 289.">[289]</a> On 26 March,
1664, the shipwrights and caulkers at Deptford are complained
of because they work very slowly, and 'give ill
language' when pressed to work<a name="Anchor-290" id="Anchor-290"></a><a href="#Footnote-290" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 290.">[290]</a>. Later on, in January,
1671, Commissioner John Cox appears to have had almost
as much trouble with the master workmen and their instruments
in Chatham dockyard. They were remiss in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>attendance, and met his efforts at their amendment by passive
resistance<a name="Anchor-291" id="Anchor-291"></a><a href="#Footnote-291" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 291.">[291]</a>.</p>


<p class="mt2">The two great shipbuilding years of our period were 1666
and 1679—the first accounted for by the Second Dutch
War, and the latter by the Act of 1677 for thirty new ships
to which I have already referred<a name="Anchor-292" id="Anchor-292"></a><a href="#Footnote-292" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 292.">[292]</a>. How much was done
during the Restoration period to strengthen the navy on its
material side can be realised by a comparison made in
tabular form in Pepys's <cite>Register of Ships</cite><a name="Anchor-293" id="Anchor-293"></a><a href="#Footnote-293" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 293.">[293]</a>. In 1660 the navy
consisted of 156 vessels, in 1688 of 173; but a comparison of
numbers gives no adequate idea of relative strength. In 1660
there were only 3 first rates as against 9 in 1688; second
rates, 11 at both dates; third rates, 16 against 39; fourth
rates, 45 against 41; fifth rates, 37 against 2; sixth rates,
23 against 6—shewing that the tendency had been to build
bigger ships. In 1660 there were only 30 ships of the first
three rates, but in 1688 the number was nearly doubled,
rising to 59. Another feature in the table is the development
of the fireship and the yacht<a name="Anchor-294" id="Anchor-294"></a><a href="#Footnote-294" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 294.">[294]</a>. In 1660 there were no fireships
in the navy; in 1688, 26. In 1660 there was one yacht,
and in 1688 there were 14. The strength of the fleet may also
be tested in another way, by comparing tonnage, men, and
guns<a name="Anchor-295" id="Anchor-295"></a><a href="#Footnote-295" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 295.">[295]</a>. In 1660 the tonnage was 62,594; in 1688, 101,032.
In 1660 the number of men borne on the sea establishment
was 19,551; in 1688,41,940. In 1660 the total number of
guns was 4,642; in 1688, 6,954.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>In connexion with guns, the important achievement of
the period was the systematising, under the methodical hand
of Pepys, of the arrangements for determining the number
and type of the armament of each rate, and the number of
men required to work it. In 1677 he drew up a 'general
establishment' of men and guns<a name="Anchor-296" id="Anchor-296"></a><a href="#Footnote-296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 296.">[296]</a>, and this was officially
adopted as 'a solemn, universal, and unalterable adjustment
of the gunning and manning of the whole fleet<a name="Anchor-297" id="Anchor-297"></a><a href="#Footnote-297" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 297.">[297]</a>.'</p>


<p class="mt2">Let me now sum up briefly our general conclusions.</p>

<p>In the light of the facts which I have endeavoured to set
out in these lectures, the old notion that the naval administration
of the Interregnum was pious and efficient and that
of the Restoration immoral and slack appears crude and
unsatisfying. But there is this element of truth in it—that
vigorous efforts for the regeneration of the navy were to a
certain extent rendered abortive by the corruption of the
Court and the lowness of the prevailing political tone. Able
and energetic reformers were baffled by want of money, and
this was due partly to royal extravagance and partly to
unsatisfactory relations with Parliament, which suspected
peculation and waste. Discipline also was undermined by
the introduction into the service of unfit persons, who obtained
admission and were protected from the adequate
punishment of their delinquencies by the interest of persons
of quality at Court. Further, an atmosphere was created
which enervated some of the reformers themselves. It is
remarkable that in spite of these drawbacks so much should
have been accomplished. The facts and figures contained in
the naval manuscripts in the Pepysian Library go a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>way to justify the claims made by Pepys on behalf of the
administrations with which he himself was connected, and
particularly on behalf of the Special Commission of 1686,
which, as he says, 'raised the Navy of England from the
lowest state of impotence to the most advanced step towards
a lasting and solid prosperity that (all circumstances considered)
this nation had ever seen it at.'<a name="Anchor-298" id="Anchor-298"></a><a href="#Footnote-298" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 298.">[298]</a> The characteristic
vices of the Restoration, as he describes them, are all there—'the
laziness of one, the private business or love of pleasure
in another, want of method in a third, and zeal to the affair
in most'—but except during the period 1679 to 1684 there
was no abject incompetence and some steady progress.
Even Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> understood 'the business of the sea,'<a name="Anchor-299" id="Anchor-299"></a><a href="#Footnote-299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 299.">[299]</a> 'possessed
a transcendent mastery in all maritime knowledge,'<a name="Anchor-300" id="Anchor-300"></a><a href="#Footnote-300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 300.">[300]</a>
and when he was acting as Lord High Admiral transacted
a good deal of naval business with his own hand<a name="Anchor-301" id="Anchor-301"></a><a href="#Footnote-301" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 301.">[301]</a>. James <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>
was a real authority upon shipbuilding<a name="Anchor-302" id="Anchor-302"></a><a href="#Footnote-302" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 302.">[302]</a>, took an interest in
the details of administration<a name="Anchor-303" id="Anchor-303"></a><a href="#Footnote-303" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 303.">[303]</a>, recognised the importance of
discipline, and might have restored it if destiny had not intervened.
But much more is to be attributed to the methodical
industry of their great subordinate, and to his 'daily eye and
hand' upon all departments of naval affairs. His vitality of
character and variety of interests appear in the <cite>Diary</cite>, but
from his official correspondence we get something different;
for in a document which is so true to human nature as the
<cite>Diary</cite>, it is almost inevitable that the diarist, although sufficiently
self-satisfied, should be quite unconscious of his
strongest points. We should expect business habits in a
Government official, but in his correspondence Pepys exhibits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>a methodical devotion to business which is beyond
praise. We have here sobriety and soundness of judgment;
a sense of the paramount importance of discipline, and the
exercise of a steady pressure upon others to restore it in the
navy; a high standard of personal duty, which permits no
slackness and spares no pains; and a remarkable capacity
for tactful diplomacy. The decorous self-satisfaction of the
<cite>Diary</cite> has been replaced in later years by professional pride;
and an outlook upon business affairs which had always been
intelligent, has become profoundly serious. The agreeable
vices of the <cite>Diary</cite> suggest the light irresponsible cavalier.
The official correspondence suggests that Pepys was a Puritan
at heart, although without the Puritan rigidity of practice
or narrowness of view. In his professional career he exhibits
precisely those virtues which had made the naval administration
of Blake's time a success—the virtues of the Independent
colonels who manned the administrative offices
during the First Dutch War. The change is that from the
rather dissolute-looking young Royalist painted by Lely
about 1669 to the ample wig and pursed official lips of the
later portrait by Kneller<a name="Anchor-304" id="Anchor-304"></a><a href="#Footnote-304" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 304.">[304]</a>.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that a man so observant, so experienced,
and so absorbed in the navy should have drawn the moral
of the naval history of his own time. In his <cite>Memoires of the
Royal Navy</cite><a name="Anchor-305" id="Anchor-305"></a><a href="#Footnote-305" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 305.">[305]</a>, the only work which he ever acknowledged<a name="Anchor-306" id="Anchor-306"></a><a href="#Footnote-306" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 306.">[306]</a>,
Pepys states the essential 'truths' of the 'sea œconomy' of
England, which are as valid to-day as when he wrote them
down—'that integrity and general (but unpractised) knowledge
are not alone sufficient to conduct and support a Navy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>so as to prevent its declension into a state little less unhappy
than the worst that can befall it under the want of both'; 'that
not much more (neither) is to be depended on even from
experience alone and integrity, unaccompanied with vigour
of application, assiduity, affection, strictness of discipline,
and method'; but that what is really needed is 'a strenuous
conjunction of all these.' For himself he claims due credit,
for it was 'a strenuous conjunction of all these (and that
conjunction only)' that redeemed the navy in 1686.</p>

<p>An anonymous admirer<a name="Anchor-307" id="Anchor-307"></a><a href="#Footnote-307" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 307.">[307]</a> wrote of Pepys as 'the great
treasurer of naval and maritime knowledge,' who was 'aequiponderous'
to his colleagues 'in moral, and much superior
in philosophical knowledge and the universal knowledge of
the œconomy of the navy.' Modern eulogies are phrased
more simply, but we may fairly claim for this great public
servant that he did more than anyone else under a King
who hated 'the very sight or thoughts of business'<a name="Anchor-308" id="Anchor-308"></a><a href="#Footnote-308" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 308.">[308]</a> to apply
business principles to naval administration.</p>

Captain John Hamilton reports the pressing of a lime-burner who was nearly
blind, and 'a little old cobbler of 56, taken out of his stall rather it should
seem for a pastime than service'; and letters of 1747 shew that the pressing of
mere lads, or of persons not able-bodied, was a subject of 'general and constant
complaint' (Public Record Office, <cite>Captains' Letters</cite>, H 12; <cite>Secretary's Letters</cite>,
3). In 1864 or 1865 a 'man' who weighed 70 lbs. was sent on board the
